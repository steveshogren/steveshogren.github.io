  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  In ancient times, plenty of builders did their work without math,
  and I would guess that a good portion of them likely did it faster
  then their math-doing counterparts.
</p>
<p >
  I am certain that when builders first started using math to prove
  that buildings would stand up safely, they were mocked by their
  math-less counterparts. I can hear them now, &#8220;Oh, Stephos, it takes
  you 5 times longer to prove your building will stand up, real men
  can just <em>see</em> that it will work&#8221;. Even in modern times, many
  people build houses and small buildings that probably don&#8217;t even
  need the math to really &#8220;prove&#8221; they work, but they perform the due
  diligence anyway. On the other hand, some people today still build
  houses, sheds, tree-houses, lofts, and fire pits without any
  drawings or math at at all, and why should they? They are
  responsible for the risk.
</p>
<p >
  This is all fine, but, builders who shy away from math also don&#8217;t
  build airliners, space shuttles, and skyscrapers. An aircraft
  designer who doesn&#8217;t feel like using math to prove their aircraft
  will fly is handed an &#8220;Experimental&#8221; sticker and gravely patted on
  the back.
</p>
<p >
  Today, programming is at the same place as both
  ancient <strong>and</strong> modern engineering: many projects can
  be done &#8220;by eye&#8221;, and some of the most experienced programmers are
  able to build immense projects alone without any sort of automated
  testing at all. When you go to a forum and ask for help, you are
  just as likely to hear from a &#8220;space shuttle&#8221; programmer as you are
  to hear from a &#8220;tin shack&#8221; programmer. The &#8220;space shuttle&#8221;
  programmer would be horrified to hear of working without automated
  testing and rigorous review practices, whereas the &#8220;tin shack&#8221;
  programmer would be horrified to think of the time wasted to
  even <em>learn the procedures</em> to automatically prove his code
  works as it should. The &#8220;space shuttle&#8221; programmer might work on the
  same internal financial project for months or years, finally
  releasing with zero defects; the &#8220;tin shack&#8221; programmer might churn
  out several quick web sites a day. Neither project
  is <em>better</em> then the other, they both might be perfect for
  what their business needs.
</p>
<p>
  I have heard several times from very good lone wolf programmers that
  testing just slows them down, and in some ways, it does appear to be
  a slowdown for them. Unfortunately, the cost to build even
  medium-sized projects with several workers without automated testing
  is only felt when it is too late, when the deadlines (and costs) are
  spiraling out of control.
</p>
<p>
  The disciplined application of mathematics transformed and
  solidified the field of engineering into a field far more vast and
  capable of some of the most incredible constructions imaginable.
  Would we have smart-phones, GPS, modern cars, and airliners if
  engineering had just avoided mathematics? Just imagine what the
  field of programming could grow into if we continue to learn and
  grow our testing, designing, and writing of software.
</p>
<p>
  I propose that automated testing is to programming what math was
  to ancient engineering.
