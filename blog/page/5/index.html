  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  You know what will make you a phenomenally better developer?
  Deliberate practice. How do you get such practice? By doing it every
  single day. Random bursts of effort over the odd weekend will gain
  you practically nothing comparatively, even if the time investment
  is the same. Your mind needs repetition and consistent effort to
  improve. So what do you want to get better at?  Pick your highest
  value subject: vim, regex, functional programming, meta-programming,
  OO, TDD, async co-routines, threading, graphics, web, etc, etc, and
  practice it every single day. Easy as that.
</p>
<p>
  When GitHub first came out with the &#8220;streak&#8221; feature on the front
  page, I realized it was time to stop my binge coding on the
  occasional weekend and start a system. Inspired by other recent
  system-based successes (working out every day), I decided to code
  every day for a year.
</p>
<p>
  I quickly realized that anything requiring detailed plans and
  designs is harder to do. Working though a book, on the other hand,
  is easy to start and stop. I started working through a book I had
  tried to read before: Let Over Lambda.
</p>
<p>
  Let Over Lambda is intense, filled with deeply complex concepts
  written in Common Lisp, a language with which I was only passingly
  familiar. But I managed to get through it without hardly any
  difficulty. How did I do that?
</p>
<p>
  I got a cheap netbook, and started to code on the train ride home.
  Interestingly, without any internet, I was much less distracted, and
  could just sit down and be in the zone within the minute (this from
  the guy whom it takes 20+ minutes to get in the zone at work). With
  only a limited span of ~25 minutes, I had no time to waste, and
  without people to talk to my brain just falls into it. I can only
  pinpoint a few times I could not get into the zone, and those were
  extreme circumstances of exhaustion or illness.
</p>
<p>
  In ten months, I have:
  <ul>
    <li>
      worked through Let Over Lambda once and read it twice
    </li>
    <li>
      worked twice through the PLAI programming languages book
      (once in Scheme and once in F#)
    </li>
    <li>
      read Clojure Programming, F# 3.0 Programming, and am currently
      in Real World Haskell
    </li>
    <li>
      completed the exercises up to chapter three of SICP
    </li>
    <li>
      authored a small Clojure library for run time type checking
      (don&#8217;t use mine, use Prismatic&#8217;s)
    </li>
    <li>
      prepared and given a two hour talk about macros at a local meet-up
    </li>
  </ul>
  Pretty incredible for only ~25 minutes a day! That is more
  programming books than I had read in the previous 2 years. I have
  improved mightily in such a short time, and it does not feel
  stressful in the least. Now, when I get home, if I feel like
  watching movies, cooking, or playing board games/Dark Souls all
  night, no problem! I can relax knowing I have accomplished my goals
  for the day. All in all, the last ten months have been incredible:
  some of the most rewarding, relaxing, and fulfilling months of my
  life.
</p>
<p>
  Before you scoff and point out that not everyone can take the train
  to work, consider this: get a portable computer, load up your
  environment, tools, and some pdfs. The next morning, leave for work
  ~25 minutes early. You will probably get in way sooner due to the
  decreased traffic (now you have earned back that time). Sit quietly
  in your car, and without the distractions of internet or other
  people, knock out a little programming. Maybe start with SICP (the
  best programming book I have ever read). See how much you can read
  and do before work starts. Do that for a month, every day. I
  guarantee you will learn something amazing.
