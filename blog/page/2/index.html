  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&#8217;t get focused today. My mind is a torrent of activity completely unrelated to my task at hand, so I am writing this to get these thoughts out so I can get back to work.<p />I got a call from a recruiter the other day trying to get me to come interview at this job. Right now I am working in VB.NET and Actionscript. Until this job, I was always working in open-source languages: Perl, PHP, and some Java. This is my first real divergence from that pattern, and of course it is in two languages that are, to say the least, not very popular with the open source crowd. This gets me wondering, &#8220;what if when I decide to move on, all the fun jobs look down their noses at me for working in unpopular languages?&#8221;.<p /> To be fair, I still program quite a bit outside work in my favorite languages, and that is all well and good.<p />For some reason though, that recruiter really got under my skin. I keep asking myself questions like, &#8220;is spending time right now making a Java game for the Android a good choice long term?&#8221; or, &#8220;should I spend any more time learning Python with Django, or just get more invested in Javascript and node.js?&#8221;.<p /> These are not questions I want to be asking myself. <p />So, I sit down to think about it and get it out of my system. What kind of programmer do I want to be in 5 years? I know without a moment&#8217;s hesitation. <p /> <strong>I want to be the kind of programmer who is not tied to any one language or platform, but is instantly effective and rapidly excellent in </strong><strong><em>every</em> language and platform. </strong><p />Right now, I am learning Common Lisp. Why? To learn better functional programming. Why do I play with Javascript? To be better at client-side web programming. PHP/Python? Server-side web programming. *.NET? Compiled, versioned programming. Android games? For fun! Why do I all this? Because the programmer I want to be is not constrained to his language/platform<em> at all</em>. The programmer I want to be programs at a level <em>over the language</em>.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  In ancient times, plenty of builders did their work without math,
  and I would guess that a good portion of them likely did it faster
  then their math-doing counterparts.
</p>
<p >
  I am certain that when builders first started using math to prove
  that buildings would stand up safely, they were mocked by their
  math-less counterparts. I can hear them now, &#8220;Oh, Stephos, it takes
  you 5 times longer to prove your building will stand up, real men
  can just <em>see</em> that it will work&#8221;. Even in modern times, many
  people build houses and small buildings that probably don&#8217;t even
  need the math to really &#8220;prove&#8221; they work, but they perform the due
  diligence anyway. On the other hand, some people today still build
  houses, sheds, tree-houses, lofts, and fire pits without any
  drawings or math at at all, and why should they? They are
  responsible for the risk.
</p>
<p >
  This is all fine, but, builders who shy away from math also don&#8217;t
  build airliners, space shuttles, and skyscrapers. An aircraft
  designer who doesn&#8217;t feel like using math to prove their aircraft
  will fly is handed an &#8220;Experimental&#8221; sticker and gravely patted on
  the back.
</p>
<p >
  Today, programming is at the same place as both
  ancient <strong>and</strong> modern engineering: many projects can
  be done &#8220;by eye&#8221;, and some of the most experienced programmers are
  able to build immense projects alone without any sort of automated
  testing at all. When you go to a forum and ask for help, you are
  just as likely to hear from a &#8220;space shuttle&#8221; programmer as you are
  to hear from a &#8220;tin shack&#8221; programmer. The &#8220;space shuttle&#8221;
  programmer would be horrified to hear of working without automated
  testing and rigorous review practices, whereas the &#8220;tin shack&#8221;
  programmer would be horrified to think of the time wasted to
  even <em>learn the procedures</em> to automatically prove his code
  works as it should. The &#8220;space shuttle&#8221; programmer might work on the
  same internal financial project for months or years, finally
  releasing with zero defects; the &#8220;tin shack&#8221; programmer might churn
  out several quick web sites a day. Neither project
  is <em>better</em> then the other, they both might be perfect for
  what their business needs.
</p>
<p>
  I have heard several times from very good lone wolf programmers that
  testing just slows them down, and in some ways, it does appear to be
  a slowdown for them. Unfortunately, the cost to build even
  medium-sized projects with several workers without automated testing
  is only felt when it is too late, when the deadlines (and costs) are
  spiraling out of control.
</p>
<p>
  The disciplined application of mathematics transformed and
  solidified the field of engineering into a field far more vast and
  capable of some of the most incredible constructions imaginable.
  Would we have smart-phones, GPS, modern cars, and airliners if
  engineering had just avoided mathematics? Just imagine what the
  field of programming could grow into if we continue to learn and
  grow our testing, designing, and writing of software.
</p>
<p>
  I propose that automated testing is to programming what math was
  to ancient engineering.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><br />The last three and a half years for me have been terrible. Why? Well, three and half years ago, I discovered the endless debate, Emacs vs. Vim. Being an efficiency nut, I could not fathom the horror of learning one, and by that action, not learning the other. What if the one I learned was not the &#8220;best&#8221; one? I could see that both were excellent and worth learning, but I wanted to learn both concurrently. Unfortunately, my body has a hard time learning two completely different keyboard systems at the same time. Heck, three and a half years ago, I was still learning to touch-type. <p /> So, three years pass, and I am now no farther along. <p />Additionally, I read on an almost weekly basis, articles that explain how great Emacs and vim are, you just need to learn one, and learn it well. I wanted to stick with Emacs, for the built-in lisp, and <a href="http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/3996068979/the-levels-of-emacs-proficiency">several</a> of my <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/effective-emacs">favorite</a> programmers highly advocate it. But, I wanted to pick up vim, because it is obviously the far superior text editor, and the default on Linux, and probably will help me not get Emacs <a href="http://xahlee.blogspot.com/2010/06/famous-emacs-people-with-hand-injuries.html">RSI</a> but, perversely, it is not nearly as easy to extend as Emacs. <p /> So, the debate raged in my head for three years, and I stupidly got better at neither. Then, the other day, it clicked. Vim is the greatest text editor of them all, with text objects, highly combine-able commands, and modal editing. Emacs is the greatest IDE of all, with an awesome programming language built-in and thousands of classes and libraries to build on. Vim is built in the tradition of a small, sharp UNIX tool; Emacs in the tradition of HAVING thousands of small sharp tools. <p /> Finally, in a rush, it clicked into place with earth-shattering force: I can make Vim inside Emacs, with lisp, but I really could not remake Emacs inside Vim. <p />Suddenly, in one glorious moment, the world all made sense. Vim, the greatest text editor, should be a part of Emacs, the greatest IDE! My searching had been in vain, there was no way to compare them, they are totally different tools!<p /> In my typical child-like innocence, I rolled up my sleeves, opened up an instance of Emacs, and started making Vim. A few hours later, Google pointed out the obvious: Emacs already has a vi mode built-in (viper). Better yet, with a simple file in the right place, I had <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-es/Vimpulse">vimpulse </a>(the practically complete Vim mode) installed and ready to go. Suddenly, a huge weight lifted off my chest. I am free to use the best tool for the job, and, like Huck Finn, float off down the river, leaving silly feuds behind me. If my actions here seem unnatural, an abomination, an unholy union, I encourage you, leave behind the fan-boyism, pick up your tools, and come build something with men who see their tools for what they truly are: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not a good hill to die on</span>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  At work last month, I was assigned to fix some bugs in an
  asynchronous legacy code base. My supervisor gave me a month to see
  what I could do, and to see if I could fix a few tricky bugs. The
  code is divided into two sections, a client application and a web
  server. Both the client application and the server have their own
  persistence, and they communicate through a soap web service.
</p>
<p>
  I wanted to try and write some sort of end-to-end tests around this,
  but I could not figure out how to get around that web service. I
  don&#039;t want my tests to rely on a server having to always be up,
  so I initially was planning on writing tests from the client
  database to the web service, where I would just stub some responses.
  I got about an hour into that plan, before I realized I would then
  have to do that same thing on the server, and that sort of testing
  will not really tell me what the code <i>does</i>. I needed to cover
  this whole process end-to-end.
</p>
<p>
 I walked around for a bit, thinking. Then it hit me, both the server
 and client code are written in VB.NET, and, except for the web service, work
 just like plain old highly-coupled code. Hmmm.
</p>
<p>
 For the first pass, I wrote an interface to wrap the web service,
 then used dependency injection to inject a fake web service that (and
 here is the cool part) simply calls around the web service entirely
 to the server code directly and injects a different database
 connection string, so the server talks to a second database I have
 prepared.
</p>
<p>
 Just like that, I can run, all on my machine, 99 percent of the code
 in a single end-to-end test. I can even setup several client
 databases, and rotate them out, to &quot;swap&quot; between several
 clients in the middle of the tests.
</p>
<p>
 I added a few &quot;integration&quot; tests that do talk to a real
 published testing web service, just to make sure everything is still
 in place correctly.
</p>
<p>
  Now, I said this was asynchronous, and it is, the executed
  system-under-test kicks off a thread to talk to the web service, and
  so to get it to test, I needed to wait for the thread to finish,
  then do my assertions.
</p>
<p>
 I used a system where the spun off thread will set a boolean when it
 has finished running, to let the main thread know it has finished,
 and the main thread just keeps checking that boolean until it is
 true. While hackish, that is my current working solution, as no more
 then one thread is ever spun off at a time, I can just have my test
 wait for the thread to finish, then complete the required assertions.

  So, working through the Land of Lisp book, getting the hang of it.
</p>
<p>
Chapter Six, the author starts off by talking a little about
  the Common Lisp REPL, or Read-Eval-Print-Loop that you use as sort
  of the &#8220;command line&#8221; for interacting with lisp. It is pretty cool,
  you type in code, and it executes. And then he opens the hood a
  little:
</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defun</span> <span class="nv">repl</span> <span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">loop </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">print </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">eval </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">read</span><span class="p">)))))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<p>
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA??!?!?!
</p>
<p>
I just about spit my drink all over the monitor laughing. The
function <strong>eval()</strong> evaluates whatever text is passed in
as code, in this case, from the command line via the obviously
named <strong>read</strong> and after executing
it, <strong>print()</strong> prints the result, and it just does that
forever till you quit.
</p>
<p>
That means, you could make one of these for any language that can
evaluate strings into code. I know python has one built-in. Php can
evaluate code with eval, and a quick search shows a highly nifty (and
robust from the looks of
it) <a href="https://github.com/facebook/phpsh">REPL for php</a>
complements of facebook. Sweet. Or, you can use php -a for the
interactive mode.

<p>I have been
reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1303935530&amp;sr=8-1"

reiteration. Until chapter 20, that is. I get to the section Don&#8217;t
Mock Concrete Classes, and it clicks.
</p>
<p>
 Mocking concrete classes used to be my bread and butter. Almost every
 unit test I wrote for the last year had several mocked concrete
 implementations, to pass in as dependencies of the system under test.

<p>
For several months now, writing unit tests this way has become
increasingly irritating to me, for several reasons. First off, notice
how phpunit does a mock? With a string for the classname and the
method to mock. Obviously, in small scale this duplication is
manageable, but imagine for a second thousands of unit tests all
mocking this way, and you will realize it gets out of hand fast. More
than once in the last year I have set out to refactor a classname or
method signature, to have dozens of failing unit tests, because they
all mock the <em>string</em> of the old name.
</p>
<p>
 Secondly, and more importantly, I find this to be brittle because you
 are locking yourself into an implementation of the class you need
 mocked. What if I wanted to move that getPaymentPerDay to a different
 class? Or I changed that version of getPaymentPerDay to
 getPaymentPerMonth? I would have to traipse through every one of
 those brittle mocks and rewrite their duplicated, crystalline
 structure.
</p>
<p>
 Stupid.
</p>
<p>
My inner frustration was so great as to cause me to start thinking up
all sorts of mad ways to get around this issue. Store the code needed
to build that mock as text on the class itself, to be parsed and
executed on the fly? Check. Create massive hierarchical testing
libraries to build the mocks? Check. And all these did was mask the
real issue. <strong>I was mocking the concrete
implementation.</strong>
</p>
<p>
 So, what would mocking the interface be? Well, PayoffCalc actually
 has two public methods: getPayoffDate() and getPaymentPerDay(). The
 Velocity class only needs getPaymentPerDay(), but by mocking the
 concrete class, we are forcing it to depend on
 the <strong>whole</strong> (undefined) interface of PayoffCalc.
 Velocity does not need getPayoffDate(), but it is in the interface we
 give it (in the form of the concrete PayoffCalc).
</p>
<p>
 Whoa. Sounds
 like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle"
 target="_blank">ISP</a>. Written about by Bob Martin. Fifteen years
 ago. *Forehead smack*
</p>
<p>
I make an interface for this concept of PaymentPerDayRetriever, for
lack of a
better <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RoleInterface.html"
target="_blank">Role</a>.
</p>
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="k">interface</span> <span class="nx">PaymentPerDayRetriever</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">getPaymentPerDay</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<p>
Then use the interface in the test:
</p>
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<p>
By mocking the interface, I have freed my Velocity class from knowing
about the rest of the old PayoffCalc interface, and when I realize
later that my PayoffCalc really is doing two totally separate things,
I can just move the PaymentPerDayRetriever interface to
getPaymentPerDay&#8217;s new home (probably on the PaymentRepository, not
shown here).
</p>
<p>
 While this example only used one method per interface, in reality, it
 would have all the methods necessary to complete that aspect of the
 class.
</p>
<p>
Fascinating.

  <div class="entry-content">I have been playing around with lisp off and on for some time now. I started out in Emacs Lisp, making Emacs play as nice (nicer in some ways) as any available php ide, but then dropped off after discovering <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a> from JetBrains. When I heard about <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">Land of Lisp</a>, I was intrigued and picked up a copy to work through over Christmas, got a few chapters in, but as Christmas tends to go for me, I spent much of the time playing board games with the family.<p /> And through it all, I never had even the slightest inkling of why <a href="http://thecleancoder.blogspot.com/2010/08/why-clojure.html">everyone</a> says you <a href="http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/writ/wl_lisp.html">should </a>learn <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">lisp</a>. <a href="http://bc.tech.coop/blog/040314.html">These guys too</a>. <p /> What is the deal? Surely, I am using it wrong. Everyone who learns it raves, and yet after using it off and on for several years, all I see is just another language, with a steeper learning curve from the non-C, non-VB syntax.<p /> Then, last week, <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp.html">this</a> article came across my browser.<p />I read just the first quarter, and there was a riot in my brain.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  Up until recently, most of my programming was in php, which does not
  support named parameters
  (<a href="http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/webprog/pcook/ch06_05.htm"
  target="_blank">this</a> doesn&#8217;t count, and it will get you lynched)
  so while switching to VB.NET and python, I have come to really
  appreciate this handy feature.
</p>
<p>
 Named parameters is one of those handy little things that can make
  your life a little easier. Say, in python, you have a function that
  takes a boolean value. Normally, I would create a variable just to
  hold that boolean value, then pass it in, to try to be easier for
  the next guy to understand.
</p>
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">do_stuff</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">window</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<p>
  Who knows what window&#8217;s parameter is? What the heck is true anyway,
  the window? <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/"
  target="_blank">PyCharm</a> knows (and if you are using python
  without it, I implore you to treat yourself to the demo) otherwise
  you have to look up the function <em>like a barbarian</em> to see
  what is going on. Sure, you can make it more clear with:
</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">do_stuff</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">collapse</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">true</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">window</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">collapse</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>Better then nothing, but still lame.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">do_stuff</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">window</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">collapse</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>
  Boom! Way easier to read, no extra variables hanging around making
  trouble. Many times I have made function parameters, called them one
  thing, then made a variable with a slightly different name to pass
  in for legibility, but no more of that crap! Now, when I have the
  inclination to make a variable just to clarify something, I just
  name the parameter and pass in the value right there, like a
  civilized gentleman should.

</p>
<p>
 Additionally, VB.NET has this too, with the slightly goofier
  syntax of the &#8220;:=&#8221;
</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='vb.net'><span class='line'><span class="n">Authenticate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pAllowBackupPassword</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>
  My cohort Daniel Miladinov pointed out that this is calling the
  assignment operator directly, since calling it with just the equals
  would perform
  an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equals_sign#In_computer_programming">equality operator</a>. Smart guy, Dan.

  <div class="entry-content">I am trying to test a project that is huge and many of the
&quot;classes&quot; are only defined as linkages from the main monster
fla. I followed <a href="http://marstonstudio.com/2007/07/28/asunit-testing-with-flash-cs3-and-actionscript-3/" target="_blank">ASUnit Tutorial</a> and got it to work with their simple examples. But when I went to test a factory and child class I had just written (hey, I would have tdd&#039;d, but then I would not have know if it was failing for the right reason), it would not compile, hanging up on some of those undefined &quot;exported linkage&quot; classes. I could not find anything about that online, I assume because developers who would want to write unit tests wouldn&#039;t rely on those exported linkage classes anyway.<p /> After waiting for a day or two and moving on, I asked the guy who maintains this project. His knee-jerk solution? Call the new AsUnitTestRunner() right in the first line of the constructor for the main fla&#039;s class. I was skeptical at best, but it worked! My guess is those exported linkages are imported into the project scope through some sort of implicit import on the constructor of the class tied to the .fla with the linkages. Sheesh.<p /> Obviously, we want to start defining those exported linkage classes as actual code, so we can run our tests without un-commenting the new AsUnitTestRunner() and then building the project, but it is a start in the right direction.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a lazy lazy man, and as such I do not like to waste time waiting for things or doing dumb stuff.<p />One place this is evident is in the browser. I like to know the cool shortcuts and tricks to speed me along my way, and Firefox has tons. Here are some neat tricks I learned this weekend.<p /> From anywhere in Firefox, <strong>Ctrl-k</strong> will take you to the &#8220;search bar&#8221; and <strong>Ctrl-L</strong> to the &#8220;address bar&#8221;, that is cool, but it gets better.<p />When opening a new tab (<strong>Ctrl+t</strong>) it always defaults your cursor to the address bar. Now many people would just say, &#8220;hey steve, don&#8217;t be a jerk, and just hit <strong>Tab</strong> to move to the search bar, then search.&#8221; This works, but I search for stuff all the time, and like to cut down on keys even further. <p /> So, I wanted to make the address bar search google for me. To do this, go to about:config, and change the <strong>keyword.URL</strong> value to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=0&amp;q=">http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=0&amp;q=</a> <p /> By default, if you type in &#8220;facebook&#8221;, Firefox will search google and redirect you to the &#8220;I&#8217;m Feeling Lucky&#8221; result, due to the gfns=1. The first result is <a href="http://facebook.com">facebook.com</a>, so that is where you go. But since much of what I type is real searching and not a url, I want to see the results! Changing your <strong>keyword.URL</strong> will still search google, but it will now take you to the results page, which saves me a few extra seconds each search. <p /> Now, in the rare case where I just want to go to Facebook.com, I pull another trick and just type &#8220;facebook&#8221; and then <strong>Ctrl-Enter</strong> which will pre-pend the &#8220;www.&#8221; and append the &#8220;.com&#8221;<p /> Wheew, in five to seven years, this might just have saved me the time I spent learning it.<p />Practicality: 2/10<br />Cool nerd learning: 9/10</p><p>EDIT - While this is cool, and I do have it working on my machines, I ended up muscle memorizing the longer but far more portable method of just <strong>Ctrl-t Tab</strong> or <strong>Ctrl-t Ctrl-k</strong>. I know this is not nearly as cool, but hey, if I can open and save a file in emacs, <em>I can do <span style="font-family:mceinline;">anything</span>.</em></p>
