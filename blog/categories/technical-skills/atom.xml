</code></pre>

<p>I recently had a gentle discussion with a new teammate about whether
or not they should learn to use Vim. My team uses a Vim emulator
inside Visual Studio and Emacs, and so we recommended he learn at
least the basics so to reduce friction when pair-programming (which we
do almost all the time).</p>

<p>He really had no desire to learn it, and took no small amount of
offense when we suggested it. The friction he felt trying to &ldquo;start
over&rdquo; really bothered him. He set out to prove that Vim was not worth
his time, and that it was actually us who needed to stop using it,
because we were the duped slow ones.</p>

<p>As any such localized experiments go, he never really came up with
anything conclusive either way. Personally, I suspect he spent more
time trying to figure out why Vim was worse than if he had just
buckled down and learned it. This got me thinking about skills we
learn as developers, and how much they cost.</p>

<h1>Skills</h1>

<p>Most skills fall along a continuum of tactical to strategic.</p>

<h3>Tactical Skills</h3>

<ul>
<li>Typing speed/accuracy</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mouse-free&rdquo; editing systems: Vim, Emacs</li>
<li>Clean coding practices</li>
<li>Refactoring tools</li>
<li>Repl Driven Development / Test Driven Development</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
</ul>


<h3>Mid-way Skills</h3>

<ul>
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Building abstractions</li>
<li>Designing simple solutions</li>
<li>Automating tasks</li>
<li>Learning new languages and frameworks</li>
</ul>


<h3>Strategic Skills</h3>

<ul>
<li>Gathering requirements</li>
<li>Training developers</li>
<li>Organizing and leading teams</li>
<li>&ldquo;Understanding the real problem&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>The more strategic the skills, the &ldquo;softer&rdquo; they become. The reason
for this is that soft skills often allow for the greatest leverage on
a project.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>Consider the developer, who by more accurately gathering requirements
for a few extra days, realizes that the stakeholder can use a
preexisting solution instead of a six month planned project. If you
consider how many keystrokes he saved, there is no way he could have
possibly typed fast enough or refactored efficiently enough to make up
for that saved six months of effort. Unless he can typed out a six
month project in a few days, his time was better spent where it
was. Obviously, these opportunities do not happen all the time, but
they <em>do</em> happen.</p>

<p>Think about the return on investment for training developers. If you
have an average team (and yes, we all do), there is a good chance you
have some lower performing developers. I have witnessed many times
where a few months of pairing to brush up the skills of a less skilled
developer allowed them to become much more productive. In terms of
total company effort, that small investment paid back many times
before the end of the year as the newly trained developer was able to
tackle their work with the renewed vigor that comes from a greater
mastery of their work.</p>

<p>Similarly, the judicious use of automation for deployment, testing,
and building greatly reduces the friction of development for entire
teams. Lowered friction means less cognitive burden.</p>

<p>That being said, I think there comes a point where you have to put
fingers to keyboard and actually produce working software. Of course,
the fastest and best software is the software you never have to
write. But, when you absolutely must write or modify software, the
skill to actually execute becomes very important. Tactical skills
increase in significance the closer you get to the work.</p>

<p>While a great software tactician will never &ldquo;beat&rdquo; a great strategist
in terms of raw business value, a great strategist that is a terrible
tactician can only talk their way out of work. A strategist who
forgets or ignores good tactics is what we call an &ldquo;architecture
astronaut&rdquo; or an &ldquo;ivory tower architect&rdquo;. These disconnected
strategists eventually start to remove business value as their
solutions make less and less practical sense.</p>

<p>I think a developer who wants to improve should make sure they are
improving all across the spectrum. Don&rsquo;t focus only on strategic or
tactical skills, but seek projects and teams that will allow you to
gain skills across the board. I like to try to focus on one skill from
each side of the continuum each year. This year, it is emacs
automation and monads on the tactical side, and leading mature teams
on the strategic. By alternating readings, I find fuel to apply the
strategies using these new tactics!</p>

<p>Lastly, on the subject of &ldquo;what to study&rdquo;, I think it is possible to
study a number of subjects all across the continuum. Unless you have
weeks where you never type any code at all, you can practice and learn
new tactical techniques all the time. If it slows you down today, but
speeds you up next week, it might just be worth it. Even if it slowed
you down to a quarter your usual speed for two weeks, but then gives
you a measly 5% boost to productively after that, you&rsquo;ll earn that
time back by the end of the year, plus some. And 5% is not hard to
do. I&rsquo;d guess learning a few new navigation or refactoring shortcuts
would net you 5% easily.</p>

<p>When studying more strategic skills, the same holds, but they are
harder to learn. The best way I have found for learning strategic
skills is to read books about it, and try to work around others who
are good at it. Neither books or working with others will get you all
the way there, you also have to apply it yourself.</p>

<h1>Progression</h1>

<p>I usually recommend that the more experienced a person is, the more
mastery they should have in the tactical skills. A suggested path I&rsquo;ve
recommended for a new developer would look like this:</p>

<h3>0 &ndash; 6 Months:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Typing speed/accuracy</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Repl Driven Development / Test Driven Development</li>
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Clean coding practices</li>
<li>Designing simple solutions</li>
</ul>


<h3>0 &ndash; 2 Years:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Refactoring tools</li>
<li>Building abstractions</li>
<li>Automating tasks</li>
<li>Learning new languages and frameworks</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mouse-free&rdquo; editing systems: Vim, Emacs</li>
</ul>


<h3>0 &ndash; 50+ Years:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Gathering requirements</li>
<li>Training developers</li>
<li>Organizing and leading teams</li>
<li>Understanding the real problem</li>
</ul>


<p>This is not a hard and fast list. If you are completely unsure of what
to learn, I recommend this rough progression just to get you
started. If you are a two year developer, and you cannot touch type, I
think learning it can really help, alongside the other 0 &ndash; 2 year
skills.</p>

<p>Not all skills along the list build on a mastery of the ones below
it. A developer can absolutely get to a very senior mastery of the
strategic skills only knowing one language and using notepad.exe. I
believe that they are missing out on a deep richness that comes from
better knowing their field, and I suggest they spend some time learning new
languages and tools. The more tactical the skill, usually, the easier
it is to learn, so it won&rsquo;t take very much time to come up to
speed.</p>

<p>The hardest thing I think a more senior developer has to deal with is
humbling themselves to learn a perceived &ldquo;entry-level&rdquo; skill. I have
another post brewing about this very topic, so I&rsquo;ll not get too much
into it here. But if you have gotten to a place where you feel like
you are so senior that some skills are too &ldquo;entry-level&rdquo; for you to
learn, I think you need to humble yourself and learn them. Nothing can
be gained from pretending like they are not valuable. Additionally,
the assumption that your time is now so valuable that it is &ldquo;a waste&rdquo;
to spend it on learning tactical skills is absurd.</p>

<p>Claiming you are too good to waste on low level skills not only
belittles everyone around you, but belies a deep misunderstanding of
our field. The senior developer who takes five times as long to enter
and edit code isn&rsquo;t just spending longer to do that task, but they are
paying a missed opportunity cost in time they could have spent in more
strategic endeavors. They could have been training, planning,
gathering requirements, building better automation, etc, instead they
stubbornly claim &ldquo;typing isn&rsquo;t what software is about&rdquo;. By giving it
so little credence, they have made it most of their actual mental
effort! Take simple touch-typing. Imagine how much mental effort it
takes the hunt-and-peck typist to write out a single line of
code. That is mental overhead that is simply wasted. The developer who
doesn&rsquo;t have to think about how to move a file or edit a structure
finds themselves quickly through the tactical efforts with little
distraction, free to think deeply.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[What Book Should I Read Next?]]></title>
    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/next-book/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-26T11:46:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/next-book</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my first job, what book should I read first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Recently, a few developers I am mentoring were curious about what book
to read first. Even mid and senior level developers I&rsquo;ve known
sometimes struggle with this question.</p>

<p>If you want to be truly great, you have to read technical books and
white papers, and you have to learn new programming languages. You
could figure the content out yourself from first principles, but you
will be about 50 years behind those who just read the
books. Additionally, if you stick to a certain language, you are
limiting yourself to only thinking about a problem in a way common to
the language.</p>

<p>Just like with adding new features to a project, you should prioritize
your learning.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d start by getting into the mindset that you will need roughly a
decade and at least ten thousand high quality hours to become a master
programmer. To be able to get that many high-value hours, you will
need to carefully select your jobs, and constantly be learning new
things that actually make you a better developer.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<pre><code>    "A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming,
    is not worth knowing." - Alan Perlis
</code></pre>

<p>I agree with <a
href="http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/07/27/six-languages-to-master/">other developers</a> who assert that a language is <a
href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Perlis">not worth learning</a>
unless it teaches you something new and mind-expanding. There are exceptions of course. Maybe you want to switch stacks to get an awesome high-value job. By all means, learn the new stack.</p>

<p>If you want to follow the extremely good <a
href="http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">advice of others</a> and learn one new programming language a year, make each
one count. For example, if you are a Ruby guy, it is safe to say you
will learn nothing of really any mind-expanding value if you try to
learn PHP, Python, JavaScript, or Perl.</p>

<p>Same for the family of Java, C++, C#, or VB.NET. One of those is plenty.</p>

<p>Instead shoot for languages that will really beef up your thought
process. I like the advice given by <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">Peter Norvig</a>:</p>

<pre><code>     "Learn at least a half dozen programming languages. Include one
     language that supports class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that
     supports functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML), one that supports
     syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one that supports declarative
     specifications (like Prolog or C++ templates), one that supports
     coroutines (like Icon or Scheme), and one that supports parallelism
     (like Sisal)."
</code></pre>

<p>I would add to that my own personal list: a language that forces you
to use monands for controlling side-effects (Haskell), and a language
that allows for dependent types (Idris).</p>

<p>If you are saying, &ldquo;wow, in Python, you have to put a colon at the end
of the function signature line, unlike in Ruby, that blows my mind&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;wow, in Java, the String keyword is uppercase instead of
lowercase!&rdquo; chances are you are getting a very low return for your
investment of time.</p>

<p>What is important about a new language is <em>not</em> a new syntax. A new
syntax is just cruft that gets in the way of the new concepts. A new
concept might be closures. If you have always worked in Java, a
closure will really expand your mind. Or macros. If you have never
seen macros, the concept alone is completely foreign, not just the
syntax. That is where the value is. A good test if you are learning
something new is if you have to research what the concept even means,
without even needing to see the syntax first. For example, when I
started learning monads, I didn&rsquo;t even need to see the syntax for how
Haskell does them, I didn&rsquo;t even understand the concept <em>at all</em>, so I
could read pretty much anything about the concept and get value out of
it. That is the high value content.</p>

<h2>Frameworks</h2>

<p>I would say very few frameworks are going to expand your mind in a way
that is worth the effort to learn them. Some very select frameworks
can cause you to think of a problem in a novel way and thus expand
your mind (off the top of my head: React.js, Core.Async, Akka,
Datomic) but those are very few and far between.</p>

<p>Obviously, in production use, frameworks have their place, and they
can provide an immense boost to your day-to-day productivity and
safety, but very few overall will expand your mind in such a way that
would make you better at the craft. It is not hard to reason why. A
framework can only do what is possible in the language. If the
language is only so powerful, the framework cannot be more powerful
than that. You will be using tools that you could&rsquo;ve written yourself
with your current skill level, but you won&rsquo;t even get the benefit of
writing it yourself. Hopefully, those tools will be safer and save you
a lot of time, but saved time cranking out widgets at work will not
directly cause you to better understand programming.</p>

<h2>Paradigms</h2>

<p>It is fashionable these days to get into functional programming. If
you haven&rsquo;t learned a language that supports a functional paradigm, I
highly recommend that as a good place to start. That being the case,
don&rsquo;t forget to add a logic, a literate, and a declarative programming
language to your list too (you have ten years remember, you&rsquo;ll need a
list). Why not pile on a stack based language too?</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>While it is important to be aware of the libraries in your space, I
would say these often provide the least mind-expanding
opportunities. A library, much like a framework, is usually
constrained by the power of the language. In most languages, libraries
are just convenience abstractions at or below the same abstraction
layer as the rest of your code. I would never consider doing my
day-to-day work without the full power of available libraries, but
they are not going to help me think any better about the work.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Meta&rdquo; books</h2>

<p>A vast number of books exist that attempt to impart something of a
&ldquo;mindset&rdquo; for the developer. Usually, the author is retelling his
experiences, which can be entertaining, but of limited reuse. The best
meta books are those that use actual research and data to try to
explain our industry. Books like Peopleware, Code Complete, and
Pragmatic Programmer are great in this regard. These best books can
cause you to see the creation of software artifacts with a totally
different light: e.g. I remember first reading about using a
programming language to generate automatically the source files for a
given project. At the time for me, it was revolutionary.</p>

<h2>Pattern Books</h2>

<p>I lately have come to think &ldquo;pattern books&rdquo; like Domain Driven Design,
Design Patterns, Patterns of Enterprise Architecture, Refactoring, etc
are just a way to try to replicate missing features in a language of a
lower power. These seem to be written for entirely Java and C#, and are mostly
complex solutions to complex problems created by the lack of power of the language. Apparently, I
am not alone: <a
href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AreDesignPatternsMissingLanguageFeatures">Are Design Patterns Missing Language Features?</a></p>

<p>That being said, I think some parts of these books are helpful,
specifically, the ubiquitous language ideas from Domain Driven
Design. If your team has decided on always using the terms from a
certain book, and you are the only person who does not know them, I do
recommend at least skimming it just to ensure smooth communication.</p>

<h2>Suggestions</h2>

<p>I won&rsquo;t suggest too many books or languages, but those I do are very
highly recommended.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>

<ul>
<li>The best book I&rsquo;ve ever read. No other book I&rsquo;ve read even comes close to beating this for sheer value per minute as this book. Do all the exercies, and you&rsquo;ll be way ahead of the curve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Code Complete</li>
<li>Clean Code</li>
<li>Pragmatic Programmer</li>
<li>Productive Programming</li>
<li>Peopleware</li>
</ul>


<h2>Wrap up</h2>

<p>It takes courage to step outside your comfort zone and learn something
new. You might be the only person learning something new on your
team. That is ok! Don&rsquo;t worry about &ldquo;converting&rdquo; everyone else to the
path of learning, and do not make fun of them or the only language
they know. (Developers who only know one language take any comment
good or bad about &ldquo;their&rdquo; language as a comment about themselves.) If
you do make fun of them, you will start to resent them. It&rsquo;ll make you
look like an outsider, and they will ignore you and finally push you
out of the team.</p>

<p>When you learn a new thing, be very careful to not run around trying
to use it everywhere. I am very careful to not use any new tool in
production until I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;moved on&rdquo; to learning another tool, so I could
critically consider the best tool for the job without the &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo;
effect clouding my judgment.</p>

<p>My experience has been: keep getting better, and you will find
yourself in better and better places to work. A person who puts in the
effort to really master the craft is easy to spot and hard to
fake. Most people want to work with those who think like them, and you
cannot think like a master engineer only knowing one tool, so get
started now, and have fun!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Inverted Polymorphism with Pattern Matching]]></title>
    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/inversed-polymorphism/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-28T22:05:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/inversed-polymorphism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my last post on the power of pattern matching, we saw how powerful
the <code>match</code> statement is in F#. Using <code>match</code> allows the compiler to
give us warnings for missing cases, no matter what the type.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how pattern matching changes our design, allowing for an
inversion of the usual OO way of polymorphism. Here is an example that
is probably familiar to everyone: getting a database connection.</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>public interface IPaymentRepository {
    IEnumerable&lt;IPayment&gt; GetAll ();
}
// InMemory.cs
public class InMemory : IPaymentRepository {
    public IEnumerable&lt;IPayment&gt; GetAll (){
        return Config.payments.Values;
    }
}
// Postgres.cs
public class Postgres : IPaymentRepository {
    public IEnumerable&lt;IPayment&gt; GetAll (){
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
// RepositoryFactory.cs
public class RepositoryFactory {
    public static IPaymentRepository GetPaymentRepo () {
        if (Config.configuration["useInMemory"] == "true") {
            return new InMemory();
        } else {
            return new Postgres();
        }
    }
}

// somewhere in the code...
var repo = RepositoryFactory.GetPaymentRepo();
var payments = repo.GetAll();
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In our example here, we have two concrete implementers of the
<code>IPaymentRepository</code>, each one with their own implementations. This is
a typical OO way to deal with polymorphism. Usually, &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;
would put each of these classes in their own files.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how we would invert the polymorphism of the C# classes
and interfaces to use pattern matching.</p>

<p>``` fsharp
type PaymentRepository =
   | InMemory
   | Postgres</p>

<p>let GetAll = function</p>

<pre><code>| InMemory -&gt; Config.payments.Values;
| Postgres -&gt; raise(NotImplementedException())
</code></pre>

<p>let GetPaymentRepo =</p>

<pre><code>match Config.configuration.["useInMemory"] with
    | "true" -&gt; InMemory
    | _ -&gt; Postgres 
</code></pre>

<p>// somewhere in the code &hellip;
let repo = Payments.GetPaymentRepo
let payments = Payments.GetAll repo
```</p>

<p>Notice how we separated our behavior from our types? The
<code>PaymentRepository.InMemory</code> and the <code>PaymentRepository.Postgres</code> now
are just empty types, much like an <code>Enum</code>. We are still able to get
polymorphic behavior from them, using <code>match</code>.</p>

<p>But why would we want to store our behavior separate from the type?</p>

<p>By storing the behavior separate from the type, changes that effect a
single behavior (adding a new function, changing a function&rsquo;s api,
removing a function) are easier, because they are all grouped
together. A change to the api of the <code>GetAll</code> function is harder in
the traditional OO interface structure, requiring modifying several
files.</p>

<p>Similarly, a change requiring adding a new type is difficult in a
pattern matching structure, as it will require finding every pattern
match and adding in the additional case. Thankfully, the F# compiler
checks both pattern matches and interfaces for us, letting us use the
best tool for the job!</p>

<p>As to safety, adding a new type is easy with interfaces, but the
developer is left without assistance to find all places the concrete
classes are instantiated and add the new type. Neither compiler will
offer any warnings for a new interface subclass. For pattern matching
polymorphism, the compiler will warn that there are missing cases
every place a change needs to be made. While harder to add a new type
with pattern matching, it is safer.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
<th> Adding a Type  </th>
<th> Modifying Behavior </th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>

<td> Harder / Safe </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Pattern Matching Types</strong>  </td>
<td>  Harder / Safe  </td>
<td> Easier / Safe</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br />


<p>I almost always find myself modifying the functions of an
interface more than I find myself adding new types. For that typical
use case, pattern matching is probably the better choice.</p>

<p>Consider the change where we want to add a new function to the
<code>IPaymentRepository</code> interface and change the location of the in
memory dictionary to be stored internally. In the interfaces and
classes example, that requires editing <em>three separate files</em>.</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>// IPaymentRepostory.cs
public interface IPaymentRepository {
    IEnumerable&lt;IPayment&gt; GetAll ();
    void Add(IPayment payment);
}
// InMemory.cs
public class InMemory : IPaymentRepository {
    public Dictionary&lt;int, IPayment&gt; payments = new Dictionary&lt;int, IPayment&gt;();
    public void Add(IPayment payment) {
        payments.Add(payment.GetId(),payment);
    }
    public IEnumerable&lt;IPayment&gt; GetAll (){
        return payments.Values;
    }
}
// Postgres.cs
public class Postgres : IPaymentRepository {
    public void Add(IPayment payment) {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
    public IEnumerable&lt;IPayment&gt; GetAll (){
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Here is the change to add a new function in the pattern matching example:</p>

<p>``` fsharp
type PaymentRepository =
   | InMemory of Dictionary&lt;int, IPayment>
   | Postgres</p>

<p>let Add db (payment:IPayment) =</p>

<pre><code>match db with
    | InMemory payments -&gt; payments.Add(payment.GetId(),payment);
    | Postgres -&gt; raise(NotImplementedException())
</code></pre>

<p>let GetAll = function</p>

<pre><code>    | InMemory payments -&gt; payments.Values;
    | Postgres -&gt; raise(NotImplementedException())
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In case you were concerned that these F# types do not have any state,
they actually can have fields just like regular classes. Notice the
<code>Dictionary&lt;int, IPayment&gt;</code> next to the <code>InMemory</code> type? That is a
field! The new field does not need to be named until used in a pattern
match, so the only time it is named is <code>payments</code> inside the <code>Add</code> and
<code>GetAll</code> functions after we pattern match <code>InMemory</code>. In fact, if we
didn&rsquo;t add it in the pattern match, the compiler would give us a
warning!</p>

<p>Between the options of traditional interfaces verses pattern matching,
neither way is truly the best for every circumstance: each comes with
a trade-off. I liken the trade-offs to the &ldquo;grain of the
data&rdquo;. Whichever way your system is likely to change the most, that is
the way you want to optimize your type. The good news is: in F# you
can have a mix of both, and it is relatively easy to convert back and
forth depending on how your system is changing the most.</p>

<p>Personally, I find F# pattern matching to be significantly easier to
read. The same code in C# requires twice the lines in three separate
files, which adds a complexity burden for no reason. The F# code is
safer, smaller, and easier to modify than the C# equivalent.</p>

<p>If you write code in C# or VB.NET right now, you could add in a
project in F# today. All three languages are callable from the other
two, so you could start by breaking out a small library that uses
these feature immediately. F# modules and classes are callable from C#
just like any other DLL library. In my mind, this is what sets F#
apart from other languages: it is more powerful and safe than C#, but
with high performance and interoperability with existing C# libraries.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pattern matching is a simple tool that will make your code safer and
easier to read.</p>

<p>Consider the following code that converts an Int to a string.</p>

<p>``` csharp
public enum Language {</p>

<pre><code>Spanish,
English
</code></pre>

<p>}
public static string convert(int number, Language lang) {</p>

<pre><code>string ret = "";
if (lang == Language.English) {
    switch(number) {
        case 0: ret = "zero"; break;
        case 1: ret = "one"; break;
        default: ret = "..."; break;
    }
} else if (lang == Language.Spanish) {
    switch(number) {
        case 0: ret = "zero"; break;
        case 1: ret = "uno"; break;
        default: ret = "~~~"; break;
    }
}
return ret;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>What happens when we make this simple change?</p>

<p>``` csharp
public enum Language {</p>

<pre><code>Spanish,
English,
German
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Does the code still compile? Sure does! Does the compiler/IDE offer us
any indication that something is missing? Nope! Our code has a
potential bug that is only exposed at run-time, and nothing will tell
us that. We made it fail gracefully by ensuring our code always
returns at least an empty string, but we have created a bug that can
only really be caught by something external: either automated tests or
manual checking.</p>

<p>The OO purists and &ldquo;Anti-If&rdquo; guys are probably leaping out of their
seats. &ldquo;Use classes and an interface!&rdquo; they yell. Ok, sure. I assert
that it just makes things even worse.</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>public interface ILanguage {
    String convert(int num);
}
public class Spanish : ILanguage {
    public String convert (int num) {
        var ret = "";
        switch (num) {
            case 0: ret = "zero"; break;
            case 1: ret = "uno"; break;
            default: ret = "~~~"; break;
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
public class English : ILanguage {
    public String convert (int num) {
        var ret = "";
        switch (num) {
            case 0: ret = "zero"; break;
            case 1: ret = "one"; break;
            default: ret = "..."; break;
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
// somewhere else...
public static string convert(int x, Language lang) {
    return getLanguage(lang).convert(x);
}
public static ILanguage getLanguage(Language lang) {
    switch (lang) {
        case Language.English: return new English() ; break;
        case Language.Spanish: return new Spanish() ; break;
        default: throw new Exception();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>We have turned 21 lines in one file into 36 in three files (not
counting namespaces and imports). Does this new structure give us any
additional safety when we add a new concrete implementation? How about
when we add a new enum value? This code is even more likely to cause
bugs than the first, because now we have an implicit coupling between
the enum and the concrete class. We could get rid of the enum, and
&ldquo;pass in concrete class&rdquo; but <em>something</em> still has to say which
concrete class to instantiate.</p>

<p>Imagine if the compiler could warn us when either the enum or the
class changed. Imagine if instead of having to hunt down the possible
uses, we could just compile and fix the errors.</p>

<p>Good news, we can!</p>

<p>Check out this F# code. If you have never seen F# before, I know, it
looks completely crazy! It <em>still</em> looks a little weird to me, but
just try to read it. I think you will surprise yourself. This is a
function called <code>convert</code>, and if you keep in mind that the types
always come AFTER the value, the code makes a lot more sense. A
parameter in C# would be <code>int number</code>; in F# it is written
<code>number:Int</code>. Don&rsquo;t ask me why. The <code>match number with</code> is just how
you do the equivalent to a <code>switch/case</code> in C#, but you will see in a
second it is a lot more powerful!</p>

<p>``` fsharp
let convert(number:Int, lang:Language) :string =</p>

<pre><code>match lang with
    | Language.English -&gt; 
        match number with
           | 1 -&gt; "one" 
           | 2 -&gt; "two" 
           | _ -&gt; "..."
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>We are using the same enum from the C# file, but it is missing
something, right? Where are the Spanish and German parts? I try to
compile this and what do I see?</p>

<p><code>~/Program.fs(11,11): Warning FS0025: Incomplete pattern
matches on this expression. For example, the value 'enum&lt;Language&gt;
(0)' may indicate a case not covered by the pattern(s). (FS0025)</code></p>

<p>Spittake mushroom soup, the compiler just caught a potential bug for
us! A C# run-time bug no less! Not only is this very powerful, but it
is so simple. I can code the way I normally do, only now I get
additional safety for free! And no unit or integration test would ever
catch this class of errors.</p>

<p>Heck, if you really want to keep your classes and interfaces in C#,
you can have some &ldquo;glue code&rdquo; in F#, and still get all the benefit!</p>

<p>``` fsharp
let convert(number, lang) =</p>

<pre><code>match lang with
    | Language.English -&gt; English().convert(number)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This still calls the C# class above, and now the compiler gives us a
warning when we add a new enum value!</p>

<p>In this way, pattern matching is able to clearly remove edge cases. We
converted an unsafe <code>if</code> and <code>switch</code> statement into a type safe
<code>match</code>.</p>

<p>BONUS ROUND!</p>

<p>What we have already seen of pattern matching makes it a better
<code>switch/case</code> but what about the <code>if</code> statement? Thankfully the
<code>match/with</code> statement allows for patterns matched to have a <code>when</code>
clause which only matches when the condition is true:</p>

<p>``` fsharp
let convert(number, lang) =</p>

<pre><code>match lang with
    | Language.English -&gt; 
        match number with 
            | x when x &gt; 5 -&gt; "Large!"
            | 0 -&gt; "zero"
    | Language.Spanish -&gt; 
        match number with 
            | x when x &gt; 5 -&gt; "Grande!"
            | 0 -&gt; "zero"
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Running the compiler again give us:</p>

<p><code>/home/jack/programming/monads-fsharp/monads-fsharp/Program.fs(19,19):
Warning FS0025: Incomplete pattern matches on this expression. For
example, the value '1' may indicate a case not covered by the
pattern(s). However, a pattern rule with a 'when' clause might
successfully match this value. (FS0025) (monads-fsharp)</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, it checks numbers too.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is possible to match on a combination of values, all at
once. We can convert our more complex structure to something simpler
using this trick, and the compiler is still intelligent enough to
check for missing cases.</p>

<p>``` fsharp
let convert(number, lang) =</p>

<pre><code>match lang, number with
    | Language.English, 0 -&gt; "zero" 
    | Language.English, 1 -&gt; "one"
    | Language.English, x when x &gt; 1 -&gt; "Larger than one!"
    | Language.English, _ -&gt; "dunno"
    | Language.Spanish, 0 -&gt; "zero" 
    | Language.Spanish, x when x &gt; 5 -&gt; "Grande!"
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Here we introduce the <code>_</code> which is equivalent to a <code>default</code> in a C#
<code>switch/case</code> statement. The pattern <code>Language.English, _ -&gt;</code> sets a
default for any number in <code>Language.English</code> not already matched. The
bug in the code here is the missing <code>Language.Spanish</code> with numbers
1-5. What does the compiler say?</p>

<p><code>Program.fs(11,11): Warning FS0025: Incomplete pattern matches on this
expression. For example, the value '(_,1)' may indicate a case not
covered by the pattern(s). However, a pattern rule with a 'when'
clause might successfully match this value. (FS0025) (monads-fsharp)</code></p>

<p>Lastly, let&rsquo;s show the final result of converting our original
function to F#. If your entire function is just a single pattern
match, you can remove the <code>match/with</code> line and use the <code>function</code>
keyword, and simply match against the parameters (which I reversed for
clarity, but do not need to be written).</p>

<p>```fsharp
let convert = function</p>

<pre><code>| Language.English, 0 -&gt; "zero" 
| Language.English, 1 -&gt; "one"
| Language.English, _ -&gt; "..."
| Language.Spanish, 0 -&gt; "zero" 
| Language.Spanish, 1 -&gt; "uno" 
| Language.Spanish, _ -&gt; "~~~"
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Our original 17 line convert function, converted into a <em>safer</em> 7
lines! I never had to specify what the types of lang, number and the
return type are, because the compiler is able to figure that out from
the code I wrote.</p>

<p>If you are not convinced at this point that pattern matching is a big
step forward in the safety and ease of development, I am not sure what
else would convince you. More safety means less time spent tracking
down bugs and more time adding on features!</p>

    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/intro-to-macros/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/intro-to-macros</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Macros are the most powerful way to manipulate the syntax of your language. Macros make it possible to completely modify your language to match your domain. To explain them, think for a minute about functions using the simple “substitution model” used to teach functions to beginner programmers. The substitution model has the reader replace a function call with the body of the called function.
</p>


<p>``` ruby
def doCalc ()
   return 1 + 2
end
def doAwesome (x)
   return doCalc() + x
end</p>

<h1>before substitution&hellip;</h1>

<p>def test ()
   return doAwesome(3)
end</p>

<h1>when substituted&hellip;</h1>

<p>def test ()
   return (1 + 2) + 3
end
```</p>

<p>
Ignoring scoping, the function/call system allows for immense power in programing languages. The function lets you "expand" a simple call into a much larger block of code. The expanded code can be vastly large. In our example above, the (doCalc) function is small, but it reality it could be doing hundreds of lines of code, which also would have to be substituted in place. The difference is real functions do not work this way. Real functions have their values evaluated before getting passed in as parameters.
</p>


<p dir="ltr">Macros are similar to the substitution model, with one expressed difference: by default, macros operate on the text of the code itself, not the values. Think of how expansion works in the simple if statement.</p>


<p><code>ruby
if workday(today()) do
  x = 1 + 1
else
  x = doOtherHugeCalc()
end
</code></p>

<p dir="ltr">Does the huge calc function execute each time? Not at all, you are guaranteed that only one will happen at any given run through that block of code.</p>


<p dir="ltr">Let’s say you wanted to make a generic function that would abstract away that call, and let you return the values, maybe something like this:</p>


<p>``` ruby
def ifworkday(first, second)
  if workday(today()) do</p>

<pre><code>return first
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>return second
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
x = ifworkday(1 + 1, doOtherHugeCalc())</p>

<h1>when the values are “shown”</h1>

<p>def ifworkday(2, 3)
  if workday(today()) do</p>

<pre><code>return 2
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>return 3
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
x = ifworkday(2, 3) # CALLED BOTH FUNCTIONS
```</p>

<p>
But wait, now BOTH functions get called, you are doing exactly twice as many huge calcs as needed. Now, those familiar with javascript probably are already itching with the solution, "JUST WRAP THEM IN ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS!!!". I hear you, sure that works in this super simple example, but macros let you do this without that extra wordiness.  Macros defer evaluating parameters. Think of a macro as a function, but the biggest difference is parameters DON'T get called till you choose to call them.
</p>


<p>```</p>

<h1>if it is a macro&hellip;</h1>

<p>defmacro ifworkday(first, second)
  if workday(today()) do</p>

<pre><code>return first
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>return second
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
ifworkday(1+1, doOtherHugeCalc())</p>

<h1>when the values are “shown”</h1>

<p>defmacro ifworkday(&ldquo;1+1&rdquo;, &ldquo;doOtherHugeCalc()&rdquo;)
  if workday(today()) do</p>

<pre><code>return eval("1+1")
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>return eval("doOtherHugeCalc()")
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now, in this simple ruby example, I had to use strings and eval to approximate what happens with macros in other languages. Since this is unwieldy, let’s switch to clojure, where it is more natural.</p>


<p>I said that macros defer evaluation, they do that, but they also do much more. Lets look at a clojure list.</p>

<p><code>clojure
‘(a b c d)
;;=&gt; (a b c d)
</code></p>

<p dir="ltr">This is a list of four symbols. Symbols are basically like an enum or a keyword that only equals itself. So it is possible to say:</p>


<p><code>clojure
(= ‘a ‘a)
;;=&gt; true
</code></p>

<p dir="ltr">but that’s pretty much it. If I tried to evaluate a symbol, it would complain that the symbol has no definition, since it is trying to treat it like a variable lookup.</p>


<p><code>clojure
;; nothing gets evaluated inside the list at all..
‘(a b c)
</code></p>

<p dir="ltr">Now you are left with a list of symbols, unevaluated. The defmacro form, for each parameter, gives you such a list of unevaluated symbols.</p>


<p><code>`` clojure
;;before compilation
(defmacro ifWorkday [bigCalc1, bigCalc2]
 </code>(if (workday (today))</p>

<pre><code>~bigCalc1
~bigCalc2))
</code></pre>

<p>;; the call
(ifWorkday (+ 1 1) (otherBigCalc))</p>

<p>;;&hellip; after compilation&hellip;
(defmacro ifWorkday [(+ 1 1), (otherBigCalc)]
  `(if (workday (today))</p>

<pre><code>(+ 1 1)
(otherBigCalc)))
</code></pre>

<p>;; after compilation the call gets <em>transformed</em> into:
(if (workday (today)) (+ 1 1) (otherBigCalc))
```</p>

<p dir="ltr">The ` is called syntax quote, it disables evaluation much like quote does (it just also namespaces everything inside for your convenience). The ~ is called an unquote, and it turns evaluation back on. In any given space, if you have a function called (id), and you called it like (`~id), it would mean the same as just calling (id), because you turned off evaluation, then turned it back on. Above, the bigCalc parameters are filled with the actual values passed in, the lists unevaluated of ‘(+ 1 1) and ‘(otherBigCalc). I like to think of the return from a macro as a “template” to replace the original call with. Take the call (ifWorkday (+ 1 1) (otherBigCalc)). When calling the macro, the last thing returned from the macro is expected to be a list of clojure code to replace the original call at compile time. So, at compile time, (ifWorkday (+ 1 1) (otherBigCalc)) is replaced with (if (workday (today)) (+ 1 1) (otherBigCalc)) which is the return from the macro.</p>


<p dir="ltr">But that is a stupid example. Making your own if statements is the most basic uses of macros. But it demonstrates the point: macros generate code. This is profound, but hard to grasp for the first time. Macros expand code before compilation time, and therefore can be used to generate lots of code automatically.</p>




<p>
For extra credit, let’s take a bigger example in the same vein as our custom ifWorkday. I am making a game, and in it, I want an easy abstraction that gives me back one of several options with a custom percent chance. Ideally, something like
</p>


<p><code>clojure
(if25 (doFirst) (doSecond))
</code></p>

<p>
where the number corresponds to the percent chance that the next item will be executed and returned. In this example, (doFirst) will only happen 25% of the time and (doSecond) 75% of the time. This demonstrates a more interesting use of macros, the ability to generate other functions (or even other macros). Here is the code:
</p>


<p><code>`` clojure
(defmacro make-percents []
 </code>(list ~@(map (fn [num]</p>

<pre><code>              (let [macro-name (symbol (str "if" num))]    
                `(defmacro ~macro-name [x# y#]               
                  `(if (&gt; ~~num (rand-int 100)) ~x# ~y#))))  
            (range 100))))
</code></pre>

<p>(make-percents)
```</p>

<p>
This macro only needs to be called once, and what it does is generates this:
</p>


<p><code>clojure
(defmacro if0 [x__2603__auto__ y__2604__auto__]
  `(if (&gt; 0 (rand-int 100)) ~x__2603__auto__ ~y__2604__auto__))
(defmacro if1 [x__2604__auto__ y__2605__auto__]
  `(if (&gt; 1 (rand-int 100)) ~x__2604__auto__ ~y__2605__auto__))
(defmacro if2 [x__2606__auto__ y__2607__auto__]
  `(if (&gt; 2 (rand-int 100)) ~x__2606__auto__ ~y__2607__auto__))
;;...
(defmacro if99 [x__2609__auto__ y__2601__auto__]
  `(if (&gt; 99 (rand-int 100)) ~x__2609__auto__ ~y__2601__auto__))
</code></p>

<p dir="ltr">I hope the profundity of this hits you like a ton of bricks. With under 10 lines of macro code (and calling it) we auto-generated 100 macros! This 10 lines of code gets expanded to 100 more lines! Sure, this is a simple, almost silly example, but imagine what you could do with this sort of power. In a more complex example, you could be auto-generating vast amounts of code this way, code that you don’t have to write every time by hand. Don't let the x__2506__auto__ parameter names scare you, I will explain that in a bit.</p>


<p>
Those generated macros should not be too hard to understand after the previous ifWorkday macro, and they can be called just like we expect. Let's deconstruct (make-percents).
</p>


<p><code>clojure
`(list ~@(map (fn [num]  
</code></p>

<p dir="ltr">The ~@ is like unquote from above, the only difference is instead of just unquoting a list to be evaluated, it extracts the values from the list and sticks them in place. I like to think of it as just removing the outer parens in the unquoted list.</p>


<p><code>clojure
(let [x ‘(1 2 (3 4))]
  `(+ 8 ~@x))
;; =&gt; (clojure.core/+ 8 1 2 (3 4))
</code></p>

<p dir="ltr">The (list) function is just how we make a list of elements.</p>


<p><code>clojure
(list ‘a ‘b ‘c)
;;=&gt; (a b c)
</code></p>

<p>
The (map) function has two arguments: the first, a function; the second, a list of elements to “map” over.
</p>


<p>``` clojure
~@(map (fn [num] (&hellip;))</p>

<pre><code>   (range 100))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p dir="ltr">As you can see here, the ~@() tells us to unquote the whole form, re-enabling the evaluation, and therefore running the map call. The map then calls the anonymous function 100 times, with the num being the numbers 0..99. Inside the anon function we have a let binding:</p>


<p><code>clojure
(let [macro-name (symbol (str "if" num))]
</code></p>

<p dir="ltr">This line is more simple, it makes a let that binds to the value macro-name a symbol that looks like ‘if1, ‘if2, .. depending on which iteration of the loop you are on.</p>


<p><code>clojure
`(defmacro ~macro-name [x# y#]                
  `(if (&gt; ~~num (rand-int 100)) ~x# ~y#))))
</code></p>

<p dir="ltr">Here is the actual returned “template” of the macro. The # at the end of the parameter name ensures that it is unique, which is really really useful when you consider that the code returned from a macro replaces the call in place. To make sure you don’t accidentally double bind the same name, clojure will give you a warning like “cannot let unqualified name” if you try to let a value without including the # at the end inside a template, another really handy feature. What gets generated by x# looks something like x__2506__auto__ which is guaranteed to be unique. The reason you need this is in case there was another value bound to x inside your code, it could cause a conflict, and in certain circumstances, really break your code, so this prevents such conflicts. You should only need these when creating parameters or let bindings inside the template. All the values "outside" the template do not need to have the # appended to their names, since they will not actually be a part of the returned template.</p>


<p dir="ltr">The only odd thing here is the double ~~num. Notice how many quote levels deep we are. It is possible to unquote to “step” back up a level in the template. By the time we get to the ~~num, the original function parameter of num was two “levels” higher, so to access it, we have to “step up” two levels. Let me highlight it in colors, to make it easier to see.</p>


<p><img src="/images/macro.jpg" title="" ></p>

<p dir="ltr">See how by unquoting ~macro-name one level in line 3, and unquoting ~~num two levels on line 4, we bring them both back “up” to the “red” level where they were defined? Similarly, by unquoting ~x# and ~y# one level on line 4, we bring them back “up” to their “blue” definition level? This is an incredibly powerful tool that allows immense expansion of code in a tiny amount of space. If you think of the returned code form as a “template”, this quoting and unquoting lets you step in and out of evaluation with ease.</p>


<p dir="ltr">In the end, when the (make-percents) macro is called, it produces 100 macros that are callable just like any other macro. To tell the whole story, I wrote this into my game, then decided I wanted a more sophisticated macro that could take any number of percentages, but this remained a good way to explain this specific pattern of looped macro generation.</p>


<p dir="ltr">Hopefully, this article caused you to see how incredibly powerful macros can be, allowing effectively infinite auto-generation of code. The field of macros is still very under-explored, as most languages do not allow them at all, they remain a largely undiscovered, and yet incredibly powerful tool.</p>


<p dir="ltr">For further reading, I highly recommend Let Over Lambda, the first 6 chapters of which are free <a href="http://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/toc">here</a>. Let Over Lambda is written with examples in Common Lisp, but the macro parts are very similar in Clojure, so is a valuable read.</p>
