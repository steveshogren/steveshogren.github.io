    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite things about F# is how it lets you choose how you want
to align your data.</p>

<p>In the previous posts highlighting on
<a href="http://deliberate-software.com/function-pattern-matching/">pattern matching</a>
and
<a href="http://deliberate-software.com/inversed-polymorphism/">inverted polymorphism</a>
we covered how pattern matching in F# is safer than <code>if</code>
statements and can replace classes and interfaces for polymorphism. If
you are unfamiliar with these concepts, you might want to skim those
first.</p>

<p>Today, for the 6th day of the
<a href="https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2014/11/24/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2014/">F# Advent Calendar</a>
I wanted to highlight F#&rsquo;s flexibility in solving the
&ldquo;<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExpressionProblem">expression problem</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s show the two alternatives, first here is one with interfaces:</p>

<p>``` fsharp
type IChristmasTrees =</p>

<pre><code>abstract member Cost : int -&gt; int
abstract member Colors : unit -&gt; string list
</code></pre>

<p>type PlasticTree() =</p>

<pre><code>interface IChristmasTrees with
    member this.Cost(jolly_factor) = (100 * jolly_factor) / 2
    member this.Colors() = ["green";"silver"]
</code></pre>

<p>type LiveTree() =</p>

<pre><code>let HEAD_ACHE = 15
interface IChristmasTrees with
    member this.Cost(jolly_factor) = (jolly_factor + 10) * HEAD_ACHE
    member this.Colors() = ["green";"brown"]
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now the same functionality using pattern matching and discriminated unions.</p>

<p>``` fsharp
type IChristmasTrees2 =
  | PlasticTree
  | LiveTree</p>

<p>let colors = function
  | PlasticTree &ndash;> [&ldquo;green&rdquo;;&ldquo;silver&rdquo;]
  | LiveTree &ndash;> [&ldquo;green&rdquo;;&ldquo;brown&rdquo;]</p>

<p>let cost tree jolly_factor =
  match tree with</p>

<pre><code>| PlasticTree -&gt; (100 * jolly_factor) / 2
| LiveTree -&gt;
  let HEAD_ACHE = 15
  (jolly_factor + 10) * HEAD_ACHE
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>What changes if we want to add a new type of tree? In the class-based
example, adding a new type is quite simple, you only need to edit one
place to find all the definitions regarding the new type.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/new-interfaces.png" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>In the pattern matching example, adding a new type requires editing
every single place you created a function that matches on the
type.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/new-pattern-matching.png" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Thankfully, in both cases the compiler gives warnings about missing
functions or matches, so both are equally &ldquo;safe&rdquo;.</p>

<p>What about changing an existing function or adding a new function? We
now see the opposite behavior. Classes become harder to edit, because
the functions are spread across multiple classes.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/change-interfaces.png" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>A pattern matching system is now the easier to modify, each function
only lives in one place.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/change-pattern-matching.png" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>And that is the expression problem! The best thing about F# is that
you get to pick which one is better for each type of data! If you know
a certain type will need new behavior often, but rarely need new
types, use pattern matching. If you know there is a static set of
functions for a set of types, but the type list changes often, maybe
the traditional interfaces and classes makes the most sense.</p>

<p>There is no reason not to mix and match the two ways to handle
polymorphism, so you are free to choose the best representation for
each type of data you have!</p>

<p>Happy F#-filled Festivities!</p>

    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/emacs-project-tip/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-06T08:45:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/emacs-project-tip</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently have been working in a Clojure project which is made up of
several microservices. While trying to build in a secure method for
each service to be able to call the others, I&rsquo;ve been in several
different projects at the same time.</p>

<p>At least once I accidentally opened the wrong &ldquo;handler.clj&rdquo; buffer,
and spent a few minutes adding a function that never worked. Since I
hate doing things like this, I wanted a simple way to see what project
I was currently viewing.</p>

<p>I started with a changing the title of the frame to show the whole
path of the current buffer, like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/title.png" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The code to change the title is simple, and the default in some of the
pre-packaged emacs bundles:</p>

<p>``` common-lisp
(setq frame-title-format</p>

<pre><code>  '((:eval (if (buffer-file-name)
               (abbreviate-file-name (buffer-file-name))
             "%b"))))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This is fine, but still not great. The font is tiny and the important
part: &ldquo;octopress&rdquo; is buried. I wanted something a little more fluid,
so I could easily tell the different projects apart instantly. I came
up with the idea to color the background faintly different based on
the path of the file. Files with a path containing &ldquo;octopress&rdquo; might
be different from those containing &ldquo;.emacs&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Thankfully, <code>buffer-face-mode</code> makes it easy to change a single
property of a single buffer&rsquo;s face without changing any other
buffer. So long as you disable buffer-face-mode when closing emacs,
your files will open with the correct coloring scheme, then have the
new background overlaid.</p>

<p>While not perfect, this was the result.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/colors.png" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The colors I choose are only faintly different, but just enough for me
to tell instantly which is which.</p>

<p>The buffer colors are applied when opening a file, using these
functions:</p>

<p>``` common-lisp
(defun my-buffer-face-mode-variable (color)
  (interactive)
  (setq buffer-face-mode-face (list :background color))
  (buffer-face-mode 1))</p>

<p>(defun my-set-theme-on-mode ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((file-name (buffer-file-name)))</p>

<pre><code>(cond
;; add your own project/color mappings here
 ((string-match "halcyon" file-name) (my-buffer-face-mode-variable "#00001A"))
 ((string-match "dwarf" file-name) (my-buffer-face-mode-variable "#001A1A"))
 ((string-match "nimbus" file-name) (my-buffer-face-mode-variable "black"))
 (t ""))))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>To force them to run when opening a file, since I use helm, I set it
to execute on exiting helm for any reason:</p>

<p><code>common-lisp
(add-hook 'helm-after-action-hook 'my-set-theme-on-mode)
;; uncomment if not using helm
;; (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'my-set-theme-on-mode)
</code></p>

<p>Lastly, to make sure emacs applies my normal theme and settings to a
buffer when starting, I disable buffer-face-mode on all buffers before
exiting.</p>

<p>``` common-lisp
(defun disable-all-buffer-face-mode ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((current (get-buffer (current-buffer))))</p>

<pre><code>(-map (lambda (x) (progn (switch-to-buffer x)
                         (buffer-face-mode 0))) (buffer-list))
(switch-to-buffer current 1)))
</code></pre>

<p>(add-hook &lsquo;kill-emacs-hook 'disable-all-buffer-face-mode)
```</p>

<p>This block needs <a href="https://github.com/magnars/dash.el">dash.el</a> to get
the -map function.</p>

<p>While not the only solution, this seemed a simple and elegant way to
quickly be reminded of your current project.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<pre><code>    Learning Vim is a waste of time; I can prove it! - Anonymous
</code></pre>

<p>I recently had a gentle discussion with a new teammate about whether
or not they should learn to use Vim. My team uses a Vim emulator
inside Visual Studio and Emacs, and so we recommended he learn at
least the basics so to reduce friction when pair-programming (which we
do almost all the time).</p>

<p>He really had no desire to learn it, and took no small amount of
offense when we suggested it. The friction he felt trying to &ldquo;start
over&rdquo; really bothered him. He set out to prove that Vim was not worth
his time, and that it was actually us who needed to stop using it,
because we were the duped slow ones.</p>

<p>As any such localized experiments go, he never really came up with
anything conclusive either way. Personally, I suspect he spent more
time trying to figure out why Vim was worse than if he had just
buckled down and learned it. This got me thinking about skills we
learn as developers, and how much they cost.</p>

<h1>Skills</h1>

<p>Most skills fall along a continuum of tactical to strategic.</p>

<h3>Tactical Skills</h3>

<ul>
<li>Typing speed/accuracy</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mouse-free&rdquo; editing systems: Vim, Emacs</li>
<li>Clean coding practices</li>
<li>Refactoring tools</li>
<li>Repl Driven Development / Test Driven Development</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
</ul>


<h3>Mid-way Skills</h3>

<ul>
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Building abstractions</li>
<li>Designing simple solutions</li>
<li>Automating tasks</li>
<li>Learning new languages and frameworks</li>
</ul>


<h3>Strategic Skills</h3>

<ul>
<li>Gathering requirements</li>
<li>Training developers</li>
<li>Organizing and leading teams</li>
<li>&ldquo;Understanding the real problem&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>The more strategic the skills, the &ldquo;softer&rdquo; they become. The reason
for this is that soft skills often allow for the greatest leverage on
a project.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>Consider the developer, who by more accurately gathering requirements
for a few extra days, realizes that the stakeholder can use a
preexisting solution instead of a six month planned project. If you
consider how many keystrokes he saved, there is no way he could have
possibly typed fast enough or refactored efficiently enough to make up
for that saved six months of effort. Unless he can typed out a six
month project in a few days, his time was better spent where it
was. Obviously, these opportunities do not happen all the time, but
they <em>do</em> happen.</p>

<p>Think about the return on investment for training developers. If you
have an average team (and yes, we all do), there is a good chance you
have some lower performing developers. I have witnessed many times
where a few months of pairing to brush up the skills of a less skilled
developer allowed them to become much more productive. In terms of
total company effort, that small investment paid back many times
before the end of the year as the newly trained developer was able to
tackle their work with the renewed vigor that comes from a greater
mastery of their work.</p>

<p>Similarly, the judicious use of automation for deployment, testing,
and building greatly reduces the friction of development for entire
teams. Lowered friction means less cognitive burden.</p>

<p>That being said, I think there comes a point where you have to put
fingers to keyboard and actually produce working software. Of course,
the fastest and best software is the software you never have to
write. But, when you absolutely must write or modify software, the
skill to actually execute becomes very important. Tactical skills
increase in significance the closer you get to the work.</p>

<p>While a great software tactician will never &ldquo;beat&rdquo; a great strategist
in terms of raw business value, a great strategist that is a terrible
tactician can only talk their way out of work. A strategist who
forgets or ignores good tactics is what we call an &ldquo;architecture
astronaut&rdquo; or an &ldquo;ivory tower architect&rdquo;. These disconnected
strategists eventually start to remove business value as their
solutions make less and less practical sense.</p>

<p>I think a developer who wants to improve should make sure they are
improving all across the spectrum. Don&rsquo;t focus only on strategic or
tactical skills, but seek projects and teams that will allow you to
gain skills across the board. I like to try to focus on one skill from
each side of the continuum each year. This year, it is emacs
automation and monads on the tactical side, and leading mature teams
on the strategic. By alternating readings, I find fuel to apply the
strategies using these new tactics!</p>

<p>Lastly, on the subject of &ldquo;what to study&rdquo;, I think it is possible to
study a number of subjects all across the continuum. Unless you have
weeks where you never type any code at all, you can practice and learn
new tactical techniques all the time. If it slows you down today, but
speeds you up next week, it might just be worth it. Even if it slowed
you down to a quarter your usual speed for two weeks, but then gives
you a measly 5% boost to productively after that, you&rsquo;ll earn that
time back by the end of the year, plus some. And 5% is not hard to
do. I&rsquo;d guess learning a few new navigation or refactoring shortcuts
would net you 5% easily.</p>

<p>When studying more strategic skills, the same holds, but they are
harder to learn. The best way I have found for learning strategic
skills is to read books about it, and try to work around others who
are good at it. Neither books or working with others will get you all
the way there, you also have to apply it yourself.</p>

<h1>Progression</h1>

<p>I usually recommend that the more experienced a person is, the more
mastery they should have in the tactical skills. A suggested path I&rsquo;ve
recommended for a new developer would look like this:</p>

<h3>0 &ndash; 6 Months:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Typing speed/accuracy</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Repl Driven Development / Test Driven Development</li>
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Clean coding practices</li>
<li>Designing simple solutions</li>
</ul>


<h3>0 &ndash; 2 Years:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Refactoring tools</li>
<li>Building abstractions</li>
<li>Automating tasks</li>
<li>Learning new languages and frameworks</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mouse-free&rdquo; editing systems: Vim, Emacs</li>
</ul>


<h3>0 &ndash; 50+ Years:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Gathering requirements</li>
<li>Training developers</li>
<li>Organizing and leading teams</li>
<li>Understanding the real problem</li>
</ul>


<p>This is not a hard and fast list. If you are completely unsure of what
to learn, I recommend this rough progression just to get you
started. If you are a two year developer, and you cannot touch type, I
think learning it can really help, alongside the other 0 &ndash; 2 year
skills.</p>

<p>Not all skills along the list build on a mastery of the ones below
it. A developer can absolutely get to a very senior mastery of the
strategic skills only knowing one language and using notepad.exe. I
believe that they are missing out on a deep richness that comes from
better knowing their field, and I suggest they spend some time learning new
languages and tools. The more tactical the skill, usually, the easier
it is to learn, so it won&rsquo;t take very much time to come up to
speed.</p>

<p>The hardest thing I think a more senior developer has to deal with is
humbling themselves to learn a perceived &ldquo;entry-level&rdquo; skill. I have
another post brewing about this very topic, so I&rsquo;ll not get too much
into it here. But if you have gotten to a place where you feel like
you are so senior that some skills are too &ldquo;entry-level&rdquo; for you to
learn, I think you need to humble yourself and learn them. Nothing can
be gained from pretending like they are not valuable. Additionally,
the assumption that your time is now so valuable that it is &ldquo;a waste&rdquo;
to spend it on learning tactical skills is absurd.</p>

<p>Claiming you are too good to waste on low level skills not only
belittles everyone around you, but belies a deep misunderstanding of
our field. The senior developer who takes five times as long to enter
and edit code isn&rsquo;t just spending longer to do that task, but they are
paying a missed opportunity cost in time they could have spent in more
strategic endeavors. They could have been training, planning,
gathering requirements, building better automation, etc, instead they
stubbornly claim &ldquo;typing isn&rsquo;t what software is about&rdquo;. By giving it
so little credence, they have made it most of their actual mental
effort! Take simple touch-typing. Imagine how much mental effort it
takes the hunt-and-peck typist to write out a single line of
code. That is mental overhead that is simply wasted. The developer who
doesn&rsquo;t have to think about how to move a file or edit a structure
finds themselves quickly through the tactical efforts with little
distraction, free to think deeply.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[What Book Should I Read Next?]]></title>
    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/next-book/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-26T11:46:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/next-book</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my first job, what book should I read first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Recently, a few developers I am mentoring were curious about what book
to read first. Even mid and senior level developers I&rsquo;ve known
sometimes struggle with this question.</p>

<p>If you want to be truly great, you have to read technical books and
white papers, and you have to learn new programming languages. You
could figure the content out yourself from first principles, but you
will be about 50 years behind those who just read the
books. Additionally, if you stick to a certain language, you are
limiting yourself to only thinking about a problem in a way common to
the language.</p>

<p>Just like with adding new features to a project, you should prioritize
your learning.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d start by getting into the mindset that you will need roughly a
decade and at least ten thousand high quality hours to become a master
programmer. To be able to get that many high-value hours, you will
need to carefully select your jobs, and constantly be learning new
things that actually make you a better developer.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<pre><code>    "A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming,
    is not worth knowing." - Alan Perlis
</code></pre>

<p>I agree with <a
href="http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/07/27/six-languages-to-master/">other developers</a> who assert that a language is <a
href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Perlis">not worth learning</a>
unless it teaches you something new and mind-expanding. There are exceptions of course. Maybe you want to switch stacks to get an awesome high-value job. By all means, learn the new stack.</p>

<p>If you want to follow the extremely good <a
href="http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">advice of others</a> and learn one new programming language a year, make each
one count. For example, if you are a Ruby guy, it is safe to say you
will learn nothing of really any mind-expanding value if you try to
learn PHP, Python, JavaScript, or Perl.</p>

<p>Same for the family of Java, C++, C#, or VB.NET. One of those is plenty.</p>

<p>Instead shoot for languages that will really beef up your thought
process. I like the advice given by <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">Peter Norvig</a>:</p>

<pre><code>     "Learn at least a half dozen programming languages. Include one
     language that supports class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that
     supports functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML), one that supports
     syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one that supports declarative
     specifications (like Prolog or C++ templates), one that supports
     coroutines (like Icon or Scheme), and one that supports parallelism
     (like Sisal)."
</code></pre>

<p>I would add to that my own personal list: a language that forces you
to use monands for controlling side-effects (Haskell), and a language
that allows for dependent types (Idris).</p>

<p>If you are saying, &ldquo;wow, in Python, you have to put a colon at the end
of the function signature line, unlike in Ruby, that blows my mind&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;wow, in Java, the String keyword is uppercase instead of
lowercase!&rdquo; chances are you are getting a very low return for your
investment of time.</p>

<p>What is important about a new language is <em>not</em> a new syntax. A new
syntax is just cruft that gets in the way of the new concepts. A new
concept might be closures. If you have always worked in Java, a
closure will really expand your mind. Or macros. If you have never
seen macros, the concept alone is completely foreign, not just the
syntax. That is where the value is. A good test if you are learning
something new is if you have to research what the concept even means,
without even needing to see the syntax first. For example, when I
started learning monads, I didn&rsquo;t even need to see the syntax for how
Haskell does them, I didn&rsquo;t even understand the concept <em>at all</em>, so I
could read pretty much anything about the concept and get value out of
it. That is the high value content.</p>

<h2>Frameworks</h2>

<p>I would say very few frameworks are going to expand your mind in a way
that is worth the effort to learn them. Some very select frameworks
can cause you to think of a problem in a novel way and thus expand
your mind (off the top of my head: React.js, Core.Async, Akka,
Datomic) but those are very few and far between.</p>

<p>Obviously, in production use, frameworks have their place, and they
can provide an immense boost to your day-to-day productivity and
safety, but very few overall will expand your mind in such a way that
would make you better at the craft. It is not hard to reason why. A
framework can only do what is possible in the language. If the
language is only so powerful, the framework cannot be more powerful
than that. You will be using tools that you could&rsquo;ve written yourself
with your current skill level, but you won&rsquo;t even get the benefit of
writing it yourself. Hopefully, those tools will be safer and save you
a lot of time, but saved time cranking out widgets at work will not
directly cause you to better understand programming.</p>

<h2>Paradigms</h2>

<p>It is fashionable these days to get into functional programming. If
you haven&rsquo;t learned a language that supports a functional paradigm, I
highly recommend that as a good place to start. That being the case,
don&rsquo;t forget to add a logic, a literate, and a declarative programming
language to your list too (you have ten years remember, you&rsquo;ll need a
list). Why not pile on a stack based language too?</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>While it is important to be aware of the libraries in your space, I
would say these often provide the least mind-expanding
opportunities. A library, much like a framework, is usually
constrained by the power of the language. In most languages, libraries
are just convenience abstractions at or below the same abstraction
layer as the rest of your code. I would never consider doing my
day-to-day work without the full power of available libraries, but
they are not going to help me think any better about the work.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Meta&rdquo; books</h2>

<p>A vast number of books exist that attempt to impart something of a
&ldquo;mindset&rdquo; for the developer. Usually, the author is retelling his
experiences, which can be entertaining, but of limited reuse. The best
meta books are those that use actual research and data to try to
explain our industry. Books like Peopleware, Code Complete, and
Pragmatic Programmer are great in this regard. These best books can
cause you to see the creation of software artifacts with a totally
different light: e.g. I remember first reading about using a
programming language to generate automatically the source files for a
given project. At the time for me, it was revolutionary.</p>

<h2>Pattern Books</h2>

<p>I lately have come to think &ldquo;pattern books&rdquo; like Domain Driven Design,
Design Patterns, Patterns of Enterprise Architecture, Refactoring, etc
are just a way to try to replicate missing features in a language of a
lower power. These seem to be written for entirely Java and C#, and are mostly
complex solutions to complex problems created by the lack of power of the language. Apparently, I
am not alone: <a
href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AreDesignPatternsMissingLanguageFeatures">Are Design Patterns Missing Language Features?</a></p>

<p>That being said, I think some parts of these books are helpful,
specifically, the ubiquitous language ideas from Domain Driven
Design. If your team has decided on always using the terms from a
certain book, and you are the only person who does not know them, I do
recommend at least skimming it just to ensure smooth communication.</p>

<h2>Suggestions</h2>

<p>I won&rsquo;t suggest too many books or languages, but those I do are very
highly recommended.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>

<ul>
<li>The best book I&rsquo;ve ever read. No other book I&rsquo;ve read even comes close to beating this for sheer value per minute as this book. Do all the exercies, and you&rsquo;ll be way ahead of the curve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Code Complete</li>
<li>Clean Code</li>
<li>Pragmatic Programmer</li>
<li>Productive Programming</li>
<li>Peopleware</li>
</ul>


<h2>Wrap up</h2>

<p>It takes courage to step outside your comfort zone and learn something
new. You might be the only person learning something new on your
team. That is ok! Don&rsquo;t worry about &ldquo;converting&rdquo; everyone else to the
path of learning, and do not make fun of them or the only language
they know. (Developers who only know one language take any comment
good or bad about &ldquo;their&rdquo; language as a comment about themselves.) If
you do make fun of them, you will start to resent them. It&rsquo;ll make you
look like an outsider, and they will ignore you and finally push you
out of the team.</p>

<p>When you learn a new thing, be very careful to not run around trying
to use it everywhere. I am very careful to not use any new tool in
production until I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;moved on&rdquo; to learning another tool, so I could
critically consider the best tool for the job without the &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo;
effect clouding my judgment.</p>

<p>My experience has been: keep getting better, and you will find
yourself in better and better places to work. A person who puts in the
effort to really master the craft is easy to spot and hard to
fake. Most people want to work with those who think like them, and you
cannot think like a master engineer only knowing one tool, so get
started now, and have fun!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my last post on the power of pattern matching, we saw how powerful
the <code>match</code> statement is in F#. Using <code>match</code> allows the compiler to
give us warnings for missing cases, no matter what the type.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how pattern matching changes our design, allowing for an
inversion of the usual OO way of polymorphism. Here is an example that
is probably familiar to everyone: getting a database connection.</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>public interface IPaymentRepository {
    IEnumerable&lt;IPayment&gt; GetAll ();
}
// InMemory.cs
public class InMemory : IPaymentRepository {
    public IEnumerable&lt;IPayment&gt; GetAll (){
        return Config.payments.Values;
    }
}
// Postgres.cs
public class Postgres : IPaymentRepository {
    public IEnumerable&lt;IPayment&gt; GetAll (){
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
// RepositoryFactory.cs
public class RepositoryFactory {
    public static IPaymentRepository GetPaymentRepo () {
        if (Config.configuration["useInMemory"] == "true") {
            return new InMemory();
        } else {
            return new Postgres();
        }
    }
}

// somewhere in the code...
var repo = RepositoryFactory.GetPaymentRepo();
var payments = repo.GetAll();
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In our example here, we have two concrete implementers of the
<code>IPaymentRepository</code>, each one with their own implementations. This is
a typical OO way to deal with polymorphism. Usually, &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;
would put each of these classes in their own files.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how we would invert the polymorphism of the C# classes
and interfaces to use pattern matching.</p>

<p>``` fsharp
type PaymentRepository =
   | InMemory
   | Postgres</p>

<p>let GetAll = function</p>

<pre><code>| InMemory -&gt; Config.payments.Values;
| Postgres -&gt; raise(NotImplementedException())
</code></pre>

<p>let GetPaymentRepo =</p>

<pre><code>match Config.configuration.["useInMemory"] with
    | "true" -&gt; InMemory
    | _ -&gt; Postgres 
</code></pre>

<p>// somewhere in the code &hellip;
let repo = Payments.GetPaymentRepo
let payments = Payments.GetAll repo
```</p>

<p>Notice how we separated our behavior from our types? The
<code>PaymentRepository.InMemory</code> and the <code>PaymentRepository.Postgres</code> now
are just empty types, much like an <code>Enum</code>. We are still able to get
polymorphic behavior from them, using <code>match</code>.</p>

<p>But why would we want to store our behavior separate from the type?</p>

<p>By storing the behavior separate from the type, changes that effect a
single behavior (adding a new function, changing a function&rsquo;s api,
removing a function) are easier, because they are all grouped
together. A change to the api of the <code>GetAll</code> function is harder in
the traditional OO interface structure, requiring modifying several
files.</p>

<p>Similarly, a change requiring adding a new type is difficult in a
pattern matching structure, as it will require finding every pattern
match and adding in the additional case. Thankfully, the F# compiler
checks both pattern matches and interfaces for us, letting us use the
best tool for the job!</p>

<p>As to safety, adding a new type is easy with interfaces, but the
developer is left without assistance to find all places the concrete
classes are instantiated and add the new type. Neither compiler will
offer any warnings for a new interface subclass. For pattern matching
polymorphism, the compiler will warn that there are missing cases
every place a change needs to be made. While harder to add a new type
with pattern matching, it is safer.</p>

<br />


<p>I almost always find myself modifying the functions of an
interface more than I find myself adding new types. For that typical
use case, pattern matching is probably the better choice.</p>

<p>Consider the change where we want to add a new function to the
<code>IPaymentRepository</code> interface and change the location of the in
memory dictionary to be stored internally. In the interfaces and
classes example, that requires editing <em>three separate files</em>.</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>// IPaymentRepostory.cs
public interface IPaymentRepository {
    IEnumerable&lt;IPayment&gt; GetAll ();
    void Add(IPayment payment);
}
// InMemory.cs
public class InMemory : IPaymentRepository {
    public Dictionary&lt;int, IPayment&gt; payments = new Dictionary&lt;int, IPayment&gt;();
    public void Add(IPayment payment) {
        payments.Add(payment.GetId(),payment);
    }
    public IEnumerable&lt;IPayment&gt; GetAll (){
        return payments.Values;
    }
}
// Postgres.cs
public class Postgres : IPaymentRepository {
    public void Add(IPayment payment) {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
    public IEnumerable&lt;IPayment&gt; GetAll (){
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Here is the change to add a new function in the pattern matching example:</p>

<p>``` fsharp
type PaymentRepository =
   | InMemory of Dictionary&lt;int, IPayment>
   | Postgres</p>

<p>let Add db (payment:IPayment) =</p>

<pre><code>match db with
    | InMemory payments -&gt; payments.Add(payment.GetId(),payment);
    | Postgres -&gt; raise(NotImplementedException())
</code></pre>

<p>let GetAll = function</p>

<pre><code>    | InMemory payments -&gt; payments.Values;
    | Postgres -&gt; raise(NotImplementedException())
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In case you were concerned that these F# types do not have any state,
they actually can have fields just like regular classes. Notice the
<code>Dictionary&lt;int, IPayment&gt;</code> next to the <code>InMemory</code> type? That is a
field! The new field does not need to be named until used in a pattern
match, so the only time it is named is <code>payments</code> inside the <code>Add</code> and
<code>GetAll</code> functions after we pattern match <code>InMemory</code>. In fact, if we
didn&rsquo;t add it in the pattern match, the compiler would give us a
warning!</p>

<p>Between the options of traditional interfaces verses pattern matching,
neither way is truly the best for every circumstance: each comes with
a trade-off. I liken the trade-offs to the &ldquo;grain of the
data&rdquo;. Whichever way your system is likely to change the most, that is
the way you want to optimize your type. The good news is: in F# you
can have a mix of both, and it is relatively easy to convert back and
forth depending on how your system is changing the most.</p>

<p>Personally, I find F# pattern matching to be significantly easier to
read. The same code in C# requires twice the lines in three separate
files, which adds a complexity burden for no reason. The F# code is
safer, smaller, and easier to modify than the C# equivalent.</p>

<p>If you write code in C# or VB.NET right now, you could add in a
project in F# today. All three languages are callable from the other
two, so you could start by breaking out a small library that uses
these feature immediately. F# modules and classes are callable from C#
just like any other DLL library. In my mind, this is what sets F#
apart from other languages: it is more powerful and safe than C#, but
with high performance and interoperability with existing C# libraries.</p>
