    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SimpleMock is a pattern for reducing TDD damage. You can use the pattern to
organize your testing code without mocking or complicated dependency injection.</p>

<p>SimpleMock works in any language with closures that can be passed around by
reference, so off the top of my head: C#, Java, F#, Scala, PHP, C++, Ruby, and
Python. I&rsquo;m sure you can think of others.</p>

<h1>Benefits</h1>

<ul>
<li>Reduced boilerplate</li>
<li>Saves interfaces for real polymorphism</li>
<li>Simplifies test code</li>
<li>Reduces testing concerns in production code</li>
<li>Removes need for fragile IoC containers</li>
<li>Encourages better abstraction design</li>
<li>Can convert one class at a time!</li>
</ul>


<p>The SimpleMock pattern promotes a better design of your abstractions and simpler
tests. The pattern also reduces boilerplate and the pollution of your production
code with testing concerns.</p>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with the normal pattern of unit test mocking using
interfaces, dependency injection, and mock libraries, scroll down to &ldquo;The
Non-SimpleMock Way&rdquo; at the end of the post.</p>

<h1>SimpleMock Pattern</h1>

<p>The SimpleMock pattern is aptly named.</p>

<ol>
<li>Replace Test-Only Interfaces With Functions</li>
<li>Define Dependencies Inline</li>
<li>Write Better Abstractions</li>
</ol>


<h1>Step One: Replace Test-Only Interfaces With Functions</h1>

<p>My examples are in C# because that is what I got paid to write today &ndash; it is
freshest in memory. C# has an incredible ability to create and pass around
lambdas and function references. Here is an example of using functions instead
of interfaces.</p>

<p>``` csharp
public class CurrentTime : ICurrentTime {</p>

<pre><code>public DateTime GetCurrentTime() {
    return DateTime.Now();
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
public class Translator {</p>

<pre><code>private Func&lt;DateTime&gt; _getCurrentTime;

public Translator() : this(new CurrentTime().GetCurrentTime) {}

public Translator(Func&lt;DateTime&gt; getCurrentTime) {
    this._getCurrentTime = getCurrentTime;
}

public string Translate(string input) {
    return string.Format("{0}: {1}", _getCurrentTime().ToString(), input);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>/// Test Code with just lambdas
[TestCase]
public void TestCurrentTimeTranslator () {</p>

<pre><code>var now = DateTime.Now;

var sut = new Translator(() =&gt; now);

var result = sut.Translate("test");

Assert.AreEqual(now.ToString() + ": test", result);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>The test code is quite simple! No longer do we need the dependency on third
party mocking libraries, or the relatively complicated setup logic. Instead we
can simply inject the lambda at runtime, replacing that pointer. We didn&rsquo;t need
the whole interface, really we just needed the simple signature of the function.</p>

<h1>Step 2: Define Dependencies Inline</h1>

<p>We can take it even a step further. Why use constructor injection at all? Since
all we really want is a single mutable dispatch table row, why not just make it
that way?</p>

<p>``` csharp
public class Translator {</p>

<pre><code>internal Func&lt;DateTime&gt; _getCurrentTime = new CurrentTime().GetCurrentTime;

public string Translate(string input) {
    return string.Format("{0}: {1}", _getCurrentTime().ToString(), input);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>/// Test Code with just inline lambdas
[TestCase]
public void TestCurrentTimeTranslator () {</p>

<pre><code>var now = DateTime.Now;
var sut = new Translator();
sut._getCurrentTime = () =&gt; now;

var result = sut.Translate("test");

Assert.AreEqual(now.ToString() + ": test", result);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ve cleaned up our nasty multi-line indirection into a single dispatch
line! &ldquo;Go to definition&rdquo; now takes me to the actual line with the actual called
function! We&rsquo;ve replaced a dependency on a class based interface with a function
signature. The function signature <em>is</em> the interface!</p>

<p>You probably noticed we have lost something with this final version. We have
lost the ability to inject polymorphic behavior through the constructor. If you
need it, simply go back to injecting the interface in the constructor or by
passing it into the function itself. In practice, I have found this is needed
very rarely, making the SimpleMock pattern a better tool to reach for first.</p>

<h1>Step 3: Write Better Abstractions</h1>

<p>Lastly, SimpleMock actually promotes better designs. For example, a coworker was
writing some tests today and ran into a complicated situation. Take the
following sanitized code:</p>

<p>``` csharp
public class WorkDoer {</p>

<pre><code>internal Action&lt;Thing&gt; ignoreElements = new ThingIgnorer().IgnoreElements;
internal Action&lt;Thing&gt; removeIgnoredElements = new ThingRemover().RemoveElements;

public void IgnoreAndRemoveThings(Thing t1, Thing t2) {
    ignoreElements(t1);
    ignoreElements(t2);
    removeIgnoredElements(t1);
    removeIgnoredElements(t2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>How would you check that each section was called? Our naive solution was a
complicated lambda with a &ldquo;timesCalled&rdquo; counter and an if statement to assert
against each argument, but it turns nasty quickly:</p>

<p>``` csharp
/// Nasty test code
[TestCase]
public void TestWorkDoer () {</p>

<pre><code>var sut = new WorkDoer();

var ignoredCalledTimes = 0;
sut.ignoreElements = (t) =&gt; {
    ignoredCalledTimes++;
    if (ignoredCalledTimes == 1) {
        Assert.AreEqual(t1, t);
    } else {
        Assert.AreEqual(t2, t);
    }
};
var removedCalledTimes = 0;
sut.removeIgnoredElements = (t) =&gt; {
    removedCalledTimes++;
    if (removedCalledTimes == 1) {
        Assert.AreEqual(t1, t);
    } else {
        Assert.AreEqual(t2, t);
    }
};

var t1 = new Thing();
var t2 = new Thing();

var result = sut.IgnoreAndRemoveThings(t1, t2);
Assert.AreEqual(2, removedCalledTimes);
Assert.AreEqual(2, ignoredCalledTimes);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Yuck! The test is an absolute catastrophe. I see a mess of mixed concerns.
Conditionals?! In a test?! Unconscionable.</p>

<p>In situations like this, we have two easy options. Option one is to just use
a third party mocking library, replacing the functions from inside the test
code. This gives us access to all the sophisticated mocking tools available.</p>

<p>My preferred option is seeking to decomplect the production code by using better
abstractions.</p>

<p>I have found that strong reliance of mocking libraries enables worse designs.
Consider the code, what makes it so hard to test? Not knowing which element is
called when, doing the same work on two parameters, and reference mutation all
make this a poor abstraction. Why not simplify?</p>

<p>``` csharp
public class WorkDoer {</p>

<pre><code>internal Func&lt;Thing, Thing&gt; ignoreElements = new ThingIgnorer().IgnoreElements;
internal Func&lt;Thing, Thing&gt; removeIgnoredElements = new ThingRemover().RemoveElements;

public List&lt;Thing&gt; IgnoreAndRemoveThings(List&lt;Thing&gt; ts) {
    return ts.Select(t =&gt; removeIgnoredElements(ignoreElements(t)));
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>/// Simpler test
[TestCase]
public void TestWorkDoer () {</p>

<pre><code>var sut = new WorkDoer();
var expected = new Thing();
var ts = new List&lt;Thing&gt;{new Thing()};

sut.ignoreElements = (t) =&gt; new Thing();

sut.removeIgnoredElements = (t) =&gt; {
    Assert.AreEqual(t, sut.ignoreElements(t));
    return expected;
};

var result = sut.IgnoreAndRemoveThings(ts);

Assert.AreEqual(expected, result.First())
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Much better! Yes, we had to change a few signatures. We get the same work done,
but now the code is actually a lot more useful. Our test code is absolutely
comparable with anything you&rsquo;d find using a mocking library. I am absolutely
okay with using a mocking library when absolutely needed, but I always carefully
consider my abstractions and design first.</p>

<p>If mocking libraries and IoC containers are the chainsaws of the testing world,
then SimpleMock is the garden shears. Sometimes the chainsaw is absolutely the
only tool for the job, and that is fine. But for most work around the yard, you
can leave the chainsaw in the shed.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Iâ€™ve shown how you can really simplify your code with SimpleMock. The dispatch
row is clear and easy to read. We have removed some third party mocking
dependencies. You can remove a lot of the boilerplate &ldquo;for making it more
testable&rdquo; from your code. The test code is greatly simplified, and injection a
breeze. The result: much simpler code, just as easy to test.</p>

<p>Thanks to Shuwei Chen for helping me put this together!</p>

<h1>The Non-SimpleMock Way</h1>

<p>If you are familiar with unit test mocking with interfaces, this part is
probably boring. Feel free to skip.</p>

<p>The traditional way of performing C# unit test mocking involves dependency
injection and interface mocking using a mocking library. For dependency
injection, it is common to use a tool like Ninject or hand-rolled constructor
injection. For mocking, a library like Moq or Rhino Mocks is standard. Here is
an example of a class and its testing code without any business logic.</p>

<p>``` csharp
public interface ICurrentTime {</p>

<pre><code>DateTime GetCurrentTime();
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>public class CurrentTime : ICurrentTime {</p>

<pre><code>public DateTime GetCurrentTime() {
    return DateTime.Now();
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>public class Translator {</p>

<pre><code>private readonly ICurrentTime ct;

public Translator() : this(new CurrentTime()) {}

public Translator(ICurrentTime currentTime) {
    this.ct = currentTime;
}

public string Translate(string input) {
    return string.Format("{0}: {1}", ct.GetCurrentTime().ToString(), input);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>/// Test Code with Moq
[TestCase]
public void TestCurrentTimeTranslator () {</p>

<pre><code>var rightNow = DateTime.Now;
var mock = new Mock&lt;ICurrentTime&gt;();

mock.Setup(a=&gt;a.GetCurrentTime()).Returns(rightNow);

var sut = new Translator(mock.Object);

var result = sut.Translate("test");

Assert.AreEqual(rightNow.ToString() + ": test", result);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve done much C# unit testing, this should look familiar. We want to
inject some code that is potentially long-running or dynamic. We put that code
into a class, add an interface, then inject that interface into the class we
want to test. To test it, we mock the interface, creating a different concrete
class at test runtime which implements that interface. We can setup that mock to
respond with anything, which we use for assertions.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s Wrong with the Non-SimpleMock Way?</h1>

<p>The first problem is we have created a whole interface just for testing.
Interfaces are for polymorphism, but we don&rsquo;t really need polymorphism for this
class. We simply want to mock it. The constructor injection is also test code
polluting our business logic.</p>

<p>What we have done is create a very small and primitive dispatch table. The
table has one row: something that has a function with the signature of <code>() -&gt; DateTime</code> or, as it is known in C#: <code>Func&lt;DateTime&gt;</code>.  We will need to make
this primitive dispatch table for every single mock in every single class we
wish to test. That&rsquo;s a lot of boilerplate!</p>

    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/safety-rank-part-2/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-24T10:13:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/safety-rank-part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to make a model that predicts bugs.</p>

<p>I previously wrote a table for scoring language safety:
<a href="http://deliberate-software.com/programming-language-safety-algorithm/">Programming Language Safety Score</a>,
but it was extremely time consuming to score new languages or make modifications.</p>

<h2>Simplify, Simplify</h2>

<p>After being told I was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">overfitting</a>
the data, I&rsquo;ve attempted to clean up by simply checking if each category is
enforced, possible, or impossible. I score each as either 1 (language enforced),
0 (possible, but you have to remember to do it), or -1 (impossible). When the
magnitudes of the new model are compared with the previous model, they come out
very similar. The shape of the curve pretty much stays the same, which I was
told indicates that the character count weighting was a variable that didn&rsquo;t
matter.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rplot.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The code I used to generate the plot and normalize the scores can be found here:
<a href="https://github.com/steveshogren/datasciencecoursera/blob/817dec79e36b6e9a6c5a8fd5700aff7cc394b9d4/scoreplot.R">scorePlot.R</a></p>

<h2>Safety Definitions</h2>

<p>A definition of the safety checks is as follows:</p>

<p><div ng-app="TableApp2">
<div ng-controller="TableCtrl">
<table class="langtable">
<tr><th>Check</th> <th>Description</th></tr>
<tr ng-repeat="check in langChecks">
<td> {{ check.name }} </td>
<td>  {{ check.desc }}  </td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>The new scores are shown here, with a lot more languages added in:</p>

<p><p class="lead">
<div style="overflow-x:scroll">
<table class="langtable">
<tr>
<th>Safety Check</th>
<th></th>
<th>
<select ng-options="getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="languages[0]"></select>
</th>
<th>
<select ng-options="getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="languages[1]"></select>
</th>
<th>
<select ng-options="getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="languages[2]"></select>
</th>
<th>
<select ng-options="getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="languages[3]"></select>
</th>
</tr>
<tr ng-repeat="check in langChecks" score-row name="check.name" row-key="check.key"></tr>
<tr class="totals"><td>Totals</td>
<td></td>
<td ng-repeat="lang in langTotals track by $index">
 {{ lang }} 
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="totals"><td>Magnitude</td>
<td></td>
<td ng-repeat="lang in langTotals track by $index">
 {{ percentageTotals(lang) }}% 
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div></p>

<p>Current Languages:
<span ng-repeat="lang in allLanguages">
 {{ getName(lang) }}: {{ allLangTotals[$index] }}, 
</select></p>

<h2>So, What&rsquo;s the Point?</h2>

<p>To see how this model corresponds with data in the real world, I used the GitHub
API to query for the number of bugs created in repositories with more than 15
forks created in a span from 2011 to 2015. Commits were counted by summing the
commit counts of all contributors.</p>

<p>I decided to rely on the count of commits as a standard for a unit of work. My
assumption was that across fifty different projects, the commit sizes would
average out. Once the unit of work was decided on, I wanted to find the ratio of
bugs per commit for each language.</p>

<p>I collected the ratio of bugs logged per commit for each repository, and after
grouping by primary language, removed the top and bottom 25% using the
bug/commit ratio, which is a common practice in statistics to help find a more
accurate average. I summed the bugs and commits of those remaining repositories
grouped by language, finding a total average bug/commit ratio for each language
grouping. Here is that data, sorted by safety score.</p>

<p><table class="langtable">
<tr><th>Language</th>
<th>Bugs</th>
<th>Commits</th>
<th>Repositories</th>
<th>Bug/Commits</th>
<tr ng-repeat="lang in languageRatios">
<td> {{ lang.name }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.bugs }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.commits }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.repos }} </td>
<td> {{ getBugsRatio(lang) }} </td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>Here are the languages sorted by safety score with bug/commit ratios:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/errorChart.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" >
<img class="center" src="/images/bugsAverage.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I took the magnitude of the safety scores and the bug/commit ratios. After
inverting the safety scores, I overlaid them both onto a single graph.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/bothMags.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Immediately it is obvious that Ruby, Python, PHP, and Clojure all seem to strongly
buck the trend, but otherwise the languages follow a pretty consistent slope
down in bugs. Taking the correlation gives a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient">correlation coefficient</a>
of .55</p>

<h2>What About Unit Tests?</h2>

<p>Thinking that Ruby, Clojure, PHP, and Python might not correlate well due to some
other factor, I collected data on how many tests each repository had. I counted
the number of files containing &ldquo;test&rdquo; or &ldquo;spec&rdquo;, which gave the following,
sorted by tests per commit:</p>

<p><table class="langtable">
<tr><th>Language</th>
<th>Tests</th>
<th>Commits</th>
<th>Repositories</th>
<th>Tests/Commits</th></tr>
<tr ng-repeat="lang in sorter(languageRatios)">
<td> {{ lang.name }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.test }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.commits }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.repos }} </td>
<td> {{ getTestsRatio(lang) }} </td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>PHP, Python, and Ruby all have a higher then average number of tests, but
Clojure does not. Additionally, Go, Scala, and Java all also have a higher than
average number of tests, yet they score relatively average in bugs/commit.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, the current safety model I have proposed seems to account for a
moderate reduction in bugs per commit across the sampled languages, but is not
the only factor. It currently is unable to account for a significantly lower
than expected bug count in Ruby and Clojure.</p>

    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/learning-lisp-was-hard/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-17T07:02:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/learning-lisp-was-hard</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Several times in the last week people have lamented to me that they &ldquo;just don&rsquo;t
get Lisp&rdquo;. After hearing it for the third time, I thought back to my experience
learning a Lisp.</p>

<p>When I set out to learn a Lisp, I expected it would be easy.</p>

<p>I figured, &ldquo;I am pretty awesome at PHP, and have worked professionally in Perl,
Python, and Java, this should be a cakewalk!&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d read Paul Graham&rsquo;s essays on
how Lisp is his secret weapon, and figured I needed to get into this secret
weapon stuff. My ego said, &ldquo;since Paul is amazing, and I am too, I&rsquo;ll be a
natural!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I expected to tinker around with &ldquo;Lisp&rdquo; (I didn&rsquo;t know there was more
than one) and shortly master it to be able to ship a website with it.</p>

<p>What happened instead took me a little longer&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>05/11 &ndash; 06/11 &ndash; ~15 Hrs Attempted <em>Land Of Lisp</em> (gave up)</li>
<li>04/12 &ndash; 08/12 &ndash; ~60 Hrs Rewrote a PHP side project in Clojure</li>
<li>08/12 &ndash; 08/12 &ndash; ~5 Hrs Attempted <em>Let Over Lambda</em> (gave up)</li>
<li>08/12 &ndash; 09/12 &ndash; ~10 Hrs Read <em>Clojure Programming</em> twice</li>
<li>09/12 &ndash; 12/12 &ndash; ~30 Hrs Took <em>CS173 Programming Languages</em> online at Brown University</li>
<li>05/13 &ndash; 07/13 &ndash; ~50 Hrs Worked through <em>Let Over Lambda</em></li>
<li>05/13 &ndash; 07/14 &ndash; ~250 Hrs Worked through <em>SICP</em></li>
<li>07/14 &ndash; Shipped production Clojure code</li>
</ul>


<p>This shows only the major events: books and large projects, but doesn&rsquo;t show all
the countless blogs, tutorials, and tiny projects that also filled in the gaps.</p>

<p>I think Lisps started to &ldquo;click&rdquo; for me around mid 2013, about two years after
deciding that I&rsquo;d &ldquo;tinker around&rdquo; for a bit before &ldquo;mastering&rdquo; it. I was
approximately 170 hours in at that point. The book that finally made it all
click was <em>Let Over Lambda</em>, but it took me two attempts and almost a year of
pre-learning to be able to understand enough to internalize the material.</p>

<p>All said and done, I spent approximately 420 hours between Common Lisp, Racket,
Typed Racket, and Clojure before I felt confident enough to suggest shipping
Clojure at work. I don&rsquo;t claim to be a fast learner at all, and I fully expect
some people will snort with derision at how much time it took me &ndash; which is kind
of the point of this post.</p>

<p>This timeline should show those who are struggling that what you are feeling is
normal. Learning anything new is hard. The more &ldquo;new&rdquo; it is, the harder it will
be. Clojure, macros, emacs, and a repl workflow are all very different from
everything I was used to and significantly more powerful than I would&rsquo;ve
guessed. It took a long time for that to become normal, and for that power to
sink in and become a tool I anticipated having.</p>

<p>If you are struggling and feel like a failure, understand <em>there is no wrong
way</em>. It might take you a long time of repeated exposure before the alien
tooling starts to look familiar, and then comfortable. Maybe that book you are
struggling with actually IS too advanced, so find an easier one, and circle back
to the harder book later. Maybe, like me, you need some part of many different
books, tutorials, side projects, and katas.</p>

<p>If you are struggling learning and in the Philly area, I am happy to meet up to
chat. I am also happy to help over the wire as well. I understand how
demoralizing the constant battle is to learn something new, especially when it
feels like your ego is on the line and the whole internet is pressuring you to
learn new things. Don&rsquo;t give up, it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>

<h1>Was it worth it?</h1>

<p>I can anticipate the follow up question: &ldquo;was it worth it?&rdquo; Absolutely yes. I
now feel a fluid comfort with my current professional stack (C#, F#, Clojure,
and JS) that previously I did not have. I am significantly more productive at
programming, regardless of the language. Work that was previously challenging is
now trivial, and work that was previously &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; now feels fun and
challenging. Was it learning Lisp specifically that caused all those changes?
Probably not, but I believe it was learning something far outside my normal
comfort zone that made the difference. I think I would have had equivalent
experiences had I invested that time learning Scala (the ML parts), Haskell,
Idris, J, R, Forth, etc.</p>

hard. Counter-intuitively, the most exhausting part is <em>after</em> you&rsquo;ve gained a
good comprehension of the tool, and now, filled with excitement, you try to
explain it to someone else.</p>

<p>They almost always react with hostility.</p>

<p>What is going on? You just took time to learn this exciting tool that could save
everyone a lot of time, and not only do they not care, but they resent you for
it!  Don&rsquo;t they see how this could be great for everyone?</p>

<p>The issue, like humans, is complex and dynamic. Maybe they feel like you&rsquo;ve now
made them look lazy in comparison. Maybe they have tried other tools in the past
only to discover they weren&rsquo;t as a good as promised. Maybe they are afraid they
won&rsquo;t be able to learn the new tool as quickly as they need to, and will be left
behind. Maybe they are afraid all the time they spent learning the existing
tools will have been wasted. Maybe they are comfortable where they are, and
don&rsquo;t care about increased productivity. Maybe they are tired of learning new
things.</p>

<p>Most times I have seen this, I think the root emotion is fear. Fear of failure,
of change, of being embarrassed, of looking inferior. Fear is a powerful
emotion.</p>

<p>When you respond with further hostility, this only will compound their
fear. Should they put their comfort and ego before the needs of the business?
No, but your counterattack will only further prove to them that their fear was
deserved.</p>

<p>The final hardest part of learning a new tool is when you are forced to use an
inferior tool. Suddenly that liberating fresh air of power is replaced with a
suffocating claustrophobia of weakness. Even if the tool isn&rsquo;t really that
inferior, it now <em>feels</em> terrible. It becomes worse when you and many others
around you agree with the better value proposition of a new tool, and yet you
are still required to use the inferior tool due to someone in power blocking you
for political reasons.</p>

<p>For the developer who sets out to learn new things, you must learn to deal with
inferior tools. Once you start learning, you will always find yourself in a
situation where you are required to use an inferior tool. For me, this has been
one of the hardest things to face in my career.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Programming Language Safety Score]]></title>
    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/programming-language-safety-algorithm/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-17T14:13:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/programming-language-safety-algorithm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think the time has come for a standard programming language safety
score. I want to use this model to help show that the concept of
safety is much more nuanced than a binary bit of &ldquo;has strong-static
types&rdquo;.</p>

<p>When someone says &ldquo;programming language safety&rdquo;, it typically invokes
thoughts of unit tests, long build times, and red squiggles in an
IDE. But, in day-to-day development, there are so many times when we
are bitten by things that somehow just slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>I put together this scoring model to get a sense of how safe a
language is at the primitive level, and if it isn&rsquo;t safe by default,
how much it costs to manually make it safe. Since all abstractions
eventually result in a series of primitive operations, I decided that
focusing only on primitives would still be a valuable (if incomplete)
data point. While any good library will handle all primitive checks
and present the consumer with a well-designed abstraction, in the end,
the consumer is still left wiring libraries together, building their
own primitive abstractions for integration. Due to the impossibility of
measuring the quality of abstractions in all libraries for a language,
I left that entirely out of scope of this model, unless it is designed
as a primitive check.</p>

<p>By focusing on only primitive operations: making and calling
functions, naming data, working with sequences, and dealing with
language primitive data types, I slimmed down the large range of
possible error vectors to a small handful. While in some languages it
is common to use user-defined classes to wrap around a set of
primitives, those classes are still doing the same primitive work,
just hidden behind a user-created abstraction. The more ways it is
possible to make a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; with a primitive, the more difficult it
is to build such good abstractions.</p>

<pre><code>This model is not about language "power".
</code></pre>

<p>This model is not about ranking the &ldquo;power&rdquo;, &ldquo;expressiveness&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;abstract-ability&rdquo; of a language. In any language that supports
abstractions (functions, classes, modules, naming data), I am
convinced, given enough code, all Turing complete langauges can do the
same work. This model is only about the costs to prevent unexpected
&ldquo;confusion&rdquo; between the programmer and the machine at the primitive
level.</p>

<p>Rather than focus on what is <em>possible</em> with a language, I will
instead focus on what is typically idiomatic to that community. For
example, if it is possible to achieve a level of safety in a language
but by doing something uncommon, that should not be counted.</p>

<p>To score a language, simply figure out how many characters it costs to
&ldquo;prevent&rdquo; a certain type of error, and add that to the
total. Newlines, spaces, and tabs do not count, but all other
punctuation does. If a specific check is language enforced, like F#&rsquo;s
Option or C#&rsquo;s parameter type enforcement, that is given a -30 (by
default) to make up for the lack of unit tests and code exercising
needed to run that &ldquo;path&rdquo;. Do not count import lines for libraries, as
importing the module will have a negligible effect on the code size
and complexity.</p>

<p>If there is a safety feature that is not possible to achieve
programmatically, we will add +30 (by default) for a &ldquo;every change run
and debug to fix&rdquo; cost, such as Java not having a way to prevent stack
overflow exceptions caused by recursion.</p>

<pre><code>A lower score is "safer", needing less (or no) code to achieve the same level of safety.
</code></pre>

<p>Rather than tell you my thoughts (or survey for) hard-coded
weightings, all checks are weighted the same by default. Feel free to
apply your own weightings, to better match to your or your team&rsquo;s
specific needs and preferences. The languages are masked by default to
protect the innocent. You can unmask the names and see the code used
below the table.</p>

<p>I want to see your language represented here! I&rsquo;ll happily take pull
requests for new languages: <a href="https://github.com/steveshogren/blog-source/blob/master/source/javascripts/sliders.js">blog source</a>. Just
use the &ldquo;edit language&rdquo; and &ldquo;copy to clipboard&rdquo; to build your own
language data structure.</p>

<p>I would love to see every major language represented, including major
language &ldquo;idiom communities&rdquo;. For example, Clojure and Typed Clojure
are vastly different in abilities. Similarly &ldquo;Scala &ndash; The Better Java&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Scala &ndash; The JVM Haskell&rdquo; have vastly different idioms with
apparently very separate communities.</p>

<p><div ng-show="showRealName"> Feel free to put in your own examples by
playing with the samples below. Code surrounded with &lt;! !> is ignored
from the tally, since it would vary heavily based on the language and
desired result. Variable and type names are kept at single characters,
which are counted. Feel free to add in your own language below, and
use the copy feature to extract the data structure to use in a pull
request.</p>
