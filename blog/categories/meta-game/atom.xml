  "... and it has to return 45,000 records a minute, or we are all
  screwed."
</p>


<p> <p> Monday morning, we inherited a legacy codebase. Tuesday, the
  word came down on stone tablets. Forty-five thousand records a
  minute, and no amount of political maneuvering or incremental gains
  were going to do. Too many broken promises. The last team mass quit
  over three months, leaving us the two most junior
  developers. Someone high up promised big, and the buck stopped with
  us.
</p> <p> &ldquo;Does anyone even know the throughput now?&rdquo;
</p> <p> We still don&rsquo;t even have the dumb thing running on our
  machines. Two weeks later we have it running and enough data to test
  it. 2500 records a minute. When scaled to 45000 records it is still
  going 30 minutes later, so it doesn&rsquo;t even scale linearly. We are
  screwed.
</p> <p> Most of us are front-end developers who stepped forward when
  everyone else stepped back. Databases are a distant memory,
  something we maybe did a few jobs back. You &ldquo;join&rdquo; tables, right?
  What we know of this process is it selects from 2-3 dozen databases
  using an ORM while running through an engine that does some
  supposedly massive calculations on the data, returning a message with
  several hundred fields. It can&rsquo;t be that hard to speed up.
</p> <p> &ldquo;We need a new architecture, with read-optimized databases
  and queue-based messaging.&rdquo;
</p> <p> None of us have ever built such a system, but we have read
  about it, and like the faithful we nod solemnly in agreement. Why
  not? If the database is read-optimized, surely it will perform like
  we need. But a few desist.
</p> <p> Like paratroopers dropped into unknown territory without a
  map, we start to canvas the code, looking for landmarks. We split
  into two teams, one to try to speed up the current system, the other
  to start on the new architecture. Two teams trying two different
  approaches doubles our chances, right? Whiteboards around our desks
  fill with maps, glossaries, and diagrams. My team starts to dissect
  this mostly home-made ORM.
</p> <p> &ldquo;Why is this selecting from the same table twice?&rdquo;
</p> <p> The ORM generated query selects a list of id&rsquo;s from table A,
  then puts those id&rsquo;s into a list as a filter for the same table:
</p> <p>
  SELECT * FROM A WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM A WHERE &hellip;)
</p> <p> We scratch our heads a bit, but hey, that can&rsquo;t hurt
  anything, surely the database figures that sort of stuff out? Isn&rsquo;t
  that what&hellip; indexes do? Our most database-savvy developer can&rsquo;t
  stop coming back to that query. He says it doesn&rsquo;t smell
  right. Finally, he takes out the &ldquo;WHERE IN&rdquo; filter, shims in the
  query, and runs the process.
</p> <p>
  &ldquo;Guys, the whole thing, all 45k came back in 40 seconds.&rdquo;
</p> <p> We scoff at him, good joke! Our profiling showed time chewed
  up fairly evenly at every level throughout the entire
  process, not just the initial query. So the process came back,
  just empty, right? And who knows what Ancient Ones you disturbed by
  messing around with what the ORM generates, it will probably never
  work again. We run it again, 40 seconds, correct count of
  records. Odd, freak coincidence. We run it with the old filter still
  in place, it comes back 30+ minutes later, same exact data. Whoa,
  wait, what?
</p> <p> Turns out, this ORM uses SELECT-WHERE-IN for every entity
  join. That first SELECT FROM A WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM A WHERE
  &hellip;) was used as the base criteria for every single lazy look-up of
  every entity on A, which were legion. What looked like slowness
  across the entire process was really ORM lazy loading at every
  level, with that first SELECT-WHERE-IN as the final filter in a line
  of nested SELECTS, some four levels deep. That initial bad query
  gets run countless times, and when it is slow, the whole system is
  slow.
</p> <p> This is the story of how I learned an important lesson: if
  you are going to database, LEARN TO DATABASE.

  You know what will make you a phenomenally better developer?
  Deliberate practice. How do you get such practice? By doing it every
  single day. Random bursts of effort over the odd weekend will gain
  you practically nothing comparatively, even if the time investment
  is the same. Your mind needs repetition and consistent effort to
  improve. So what do you want to get better at?  Pick your highest
  value subject: vim, regex, functional programming, meta-programming,
  OO, TDD, async co-routines, threading, graphics, web, etc, etc, and
  practice it every single day. Easy as that.
</p>


<p>
  When GitHub first came out with the "streak" feature on the front
  page, I realized it was time to stop my binge coding on the
  occasional weekend and start a system. Inspired by other recent
  system-based successes (working out every day), I decided to code
  every day for a year.
</p>


<p>
  I quickly realized that anything requiring detailed plans and
  designs is harder to do. Working though a book, on the other hand,
  is easy to start and stop. I started working through a book I had
  tried to read before: Let Over Lambda.
</p>


<p>
  Let Over Lambda is intense, filled with deeply complex concepts
  written in Common Lisp, a language with which I was only passingly
  familiar. But I managed to get through it without hardly any
  difficulty. How did I do that?
</p>


<p>
  I got a cheap netbook, and started to code on the train ride home.
  Interestingly, without any internet, I was much less distracted, and
  could just sit down and be in the zone within the minute (this from
  the guy whom it takes 20+ minutes to get in the zone at work). With
  only a limited span of ~25 minutes, I had no time to waste, and
  without people to talk to my brain just falls into it. I can only
  pinpoint a few times I could not get into the zone, and those were
  extreme circumstances of exhaustion or illness.
</p>


<p>
  In ten months, I have:
  <ul>
    <li>
      worked through Let Over Lambda once and read it twice
    </li>
    <li>
      worked twice through the PLAI programming languages book
      (once in Scheme and once in F#)
    </li>
    <li>
      read Clojure Programming, F# 3.0 Programming, and am currently
      in Real World Haskell
    </li>
    <li>
      completed the exercises up to chapter three of SICP
    </li>
    <li>
      authored a small Clojure library for run time type checking
      (don't use mine, use Prismatic's)
    </li>
    <li>
      prepared and given a two hour talk about macros at a local meet-up
    </li>
  </ul>
  Pretty incredible for only ~25 minutes a day! That is more
  programming books than I had read in the previous 2 years. I have
  improved mightily in such a short time, and it does not feel
  stressful in the least. Now, when I get home, if I feel like
  watching movies, cooking, or playing board games/Dark Souls all
  night, no problem! I can relax knowing I have accomplished my goals
  for the day. All in all, the last ten months have been incredible:
  some of the most rewarding, relaxing, and fulfilling months of my
  life.
</p>


<p>
  Before you scoff and point out that not everyone can take the train
  to work, consider this: get a portable computer, load up your
  environment, tools, and some pdfs. The next morning, leave for work
  ~25 minutes early. You will probably get in way sooner due to the
  decreased traffic (now you have earned back that time). Sit quietly
  in your car, and without the distractions of internet or other
  people, knock out a little programming. Maybe start with SICP (the
  best programming book I have ever read). See how much you can read
  and do before work starts. Do that for a month, every day. I
  guarantee you will learn something amazing.

    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/501-developer/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/501-developer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
  Can we agree for this post that money, energy, time, and effort are
  all forms of power? Like literally, if I wanted to build a building,
  I am going to need tools, skills, materials, labor. I can use the
  most liquid form of power I have (cash) to acquire all these things,
  or I can use a much less liquid form of power (my time) to harvest,
  extract, refine, learn, and build my building myself. Usually,
  economies of scale mean it is dramatically more efficient for me to
  specialize in one way of converting time into liquid power. Then,
  when I need something, I simply pass that money on to someone else
  who is also a specialist.
</p>


<p>
  Now you know why I don't quarry my own stone to build an
  amphitheater in my back yard.
</p>


<p>
  When you work a job, you are converting one form of power you have:
  time (and usually skills), into another much more liquid form of
  power: money. One can extend the model to include calories and
  shelter (the power to sleep safely) along with time and skills.
  Great, this is just basic economics, right? You need power (money)
  to buy power (food and shelter) to buy power (time) to convert back
  into more power (money). Since you are "harvesting" something finite
  and therefore scarce (time out of your short life), if you are
  disciplined and lucky, you can consistently end up with a net
  positive.
</p>


<p>
  On to the point! I read a post today mentioning
  the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx">"5:01 developer"</a>. It made me mad.
</p>


<p>
  Ideas like this are so subtle they just seep into your psyche. I
  don't think anyone would say under normal conditions, "I should
  really work for free today". But, effectively, that is what this
  whole phrase is about. The phrase lets people who cram eight hours
  of work into ten hours "get back" at those that get the same work
  done in six to eight. To clarify, this title is not about "saving
  the company" or "giving back to society"; those are unusual
  conditions. No, it is a chastisement of developers who do not "give
  back to the company". Sort of a tax, for the privilege of getting
  paid to work there, you should, according to this ideal, just give
  back some of that power they gave you. Thinking about this with the
  power model, you should accept money to work there in exchange for
  your time, but, when the time comes, you should deliberately
  short-change yourself by giving them extra time. Like some sort of
  weird tip.
</p>


<p>
  Hopefully this sounds as ridiculous as it really is.
</p>


<p>
  Now, in that post, the author sort of backpedals a little bit,
  saying that <i>what he really meant</i> was a developer who stops
  thinking about development as soon as work is over: someone not
  passionate. The issue I have is the whole wording of that phrase
  assumes a passion for their <i>job</i>, not a passion for
  their <i>craft</i>.
</p>


<p>
  I do not think it makes sense to demand every person
  be <i>passionate</i> about the job they are doing. There have been
  many times I have (even at a job I normally loved) done long,
  boring, and fruitless work. I did not do that work out of my passion
  for the "Mission: Save the World of Enterprise Banking", but because
  I am a professional: I do what needs to be done to the best of my
  abilities.
</p>


<p>
  I think professionalism is very important. In others I work with, I
  want to see the attitude that causes someone to stay abreast in
  their field. I want to be around those who keep their own saws
  sharp, who come in and work hard, and who push themselves and those
  around them to be best they can.
</p>


<p>
  Back to overtime: in my experience, very few offices care enough
  about their developers to let them sharpen their saws at work, so
  why would you waste your precious free time there? Will they pay you
  more for it? Doubtful. Will they be less likely to fire you when
  times get tough? <i>Maybe</i>. Sounds to me like a lot of
  speculation. A lot of investment for a marginal or non-existent
  return. If you want more money: either ask for a raise, go take a
  raise at a new job, or work a second job on the side. Those have a
  direct impact on your income. Putting in extra hours hoping someone
  will notice and reward you for it makes about as much sense as
  assuming you will get a raise for wearing the boss's favorite color
  every day.
</p>


<p>
  Consider the person who stays one extra hour a day as an
  "investment". The typical end of the year raise scale I have seen in
  the US in companies larger than 30 people is a 0-5% increase a
  year. Uncommonly does someone get more than that, and should not be
  considered a usual practice. The typical best you can expect is
  5%, maybe a bonus (in four diverse jobs, none gave bonuses, so I
  haven't considered them personally). Back to the extra hour a day. Not
  completely out there, not putting in a vast amount extra, right?
  Well, one extra hour is 12.5% percent more hours a day. But the most
  you can expect, on average, is 5%, if you are lucky! To put it in
  perspective, I have seen guys put in 12 hour days and get fired
  because the boss didn't get along with them.
</p>


<p>
  At a <i>few</i> points in my career, I worked longer hours. Once it
  was because I truly enjoyed the work and it was fun. Another time it
  was because I felt like the extra time was going to directly pay off
  as an investment (it didn't). A few times I have stuck around to
  "wrap this off" or "help out with something deeply unusual that has
  to be done outside normal work hours". I recently recommended to my
  little brother he work longer hours, as he was hired without many
  needed skills and on shaky footing with the boss. He worked out a
  deal where he spent two extra hours a day for a couple months
  reading and practicing to get "caught up". His boss got to see his
  hustle when he was the first one in and last one out every day; he
  got to study away from the distractions of everyday life. <b>In all
  circumstances, make overtime the exception, never the rule.</b>
</p>


<p>
  One last point. Before you think me a selfish jerk about my free
  time, know that I make it a daily habit to spend 30-60 minutes
  outside work advancing my development skills. I practice interactive
  rebases, work through awesome books, do online courses, advance side
  projects, contribute to open source, give local meetup talks, and
  learn new languages. These are the basics of what I feel is
  necessary to sustain and advance myself as a professional. If I
  simply worked a 45-50 hour work week instead, I personally would not
  have the motivation to <i>afterwards</i> stay so abreast of
  important changes in the development world. I would become much less
  effective over time, never getting any better. When the need for new
  paradigms or technologies arose, I would be so stuck in a rut that
  fear and ignorance would drive all my decisions.
</p>


<p>
  Treat overtime like an investment, and make it wisely. You are
  literally mining your life for time, so make sure you are
  comfortable with your investment strategies.

    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/refactoring-not-free/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/refactoring-not-free</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Sometimes, it’s far more efficient to leave certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debts</a> unpaid.</p>


<p dir="ltr">I’m not saying we should leave messes, instead I am saying that cleaning and fixing technical debt is so important we must prioritize the most important changes first, by highest value to the team. You don't just do whatever feature is next alphabetically do you? Nope, so neither should you do that with refactorings.</p>


<p dir="ltr">Not all technical debts are created equal: they consist of varying amounts of interest as well as principal. We still don’t have a way to accurately count the cost of technical debt. Fortunately, a little effort goes a long way toward estimating the its “payoff price”. Much like paying off a real debt, paying the highest-interest debts first makes the most sense.</p>


<p dir="ltr">I’ll give you a real life example of some technical debt repayments. Last month at my work, we all agreed that all our namespaces, project names, and assembly names were woefully out of date. The naming confusion hadn't cost us a lot of time, but, like an annoying paper cut, we felt the pain whenever we looked at it. The system had outgrown the single small product it once was, and the names had not grown with it. A few project names did not even match up with their folders, causing extra disorientation every time anyone read them. We all voted to make updating all that cruft our “dev chore” of the week. Unfortunately, we did not weigh the relative cost versus the value of that cleanup to the team.</p>


<p dir="ltr">Three weeks later, we were still neck-deep in cleanup. The renaming process caused many subtle bugs because of a variety of unconsidered issues. Our work ground to a halt as we put all hands on deck to finish the task and fix all the bugs.</p>


<p dir="ltr">We hadn’t considered the terms on that technical debt. The principal was high: paying it cost weeks of nonstop effort. What about the interest? At best, it was tiny, fractions of a percent of the time it took to pay it off. How long will it take us to make that time back? Five years? Ten?</p>


<p dir="ltr">Now consider another common refactoring: renaming a private function. What does it cost to fix a badly named local function? Practically nothing, just a few keystrokes. What does it cost to leave it undone? You have to look at that bad function definition each time you work in that file. Leaving the technical debt would cost more than paying it down. Why wouldn’t you immediately pay down such a debt?</p>


<p dir="ltr">Clearly, this is not an exact science, but our refactorings will take on a very critical dimension when we add interest to the technical debt metaphor. I now evaluate any refactoring effort that would take longer than a few minutes in this mindset, thinking critically about what I do and why. I keep my big technical debt chores in a list prioritized by interest (regardless of the principal), so there is never any doubt what my next task should be.</p>

    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/how-to-escape-from-programming_language/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/how-to-escape-from-programming_language</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As time goes on, developers will be all the harder pressed to keep up with the skyrocketing number of languages and frameworks. The number of javascript libraries alone is increasing at a furious pace: Angular, Backbone, Node, Ember, Knockout, Knockback, Meteor, etc, etc, etc. Who has a chance at keeping up? While having so many options is also beneficial, it makes it more and more challenging for a single developer to stay relevant.</p>

<br />


<br />


<p>You are a good programmer. No, you are a great programmer. But, you are stuck in one development stack. You want to diversify your knowledge, experience, and skill set, but your resume reads like a one-act play. Chances are, you didn&rsquo;t deliberately choose to work in this stack. At the start of your career, the first job you landed was probably the best you could find. Several years have gone by, and you are beginning to realize that the development world is moving on.</p>

<br />


<br />


<p>Maybe you have already tried, having gone to a few interviews. Nevertheless, you’re still as stuck as when you started, because many of the cool shops are still figuring out how to do good hiring in this new, fast-changing paradigm. They want developers who already have experience in their stack, but they haven&rsquo;t realized that filtering for previous experience is only one heuristic for finding good talent. So, what are your options?</p>

<br />


<br />


<p>Here is how to escape from your language. Like all the best advice, it is simple, yet profound. It consists of the following three steps:</p>

<br />


<br />


<ol>
<li>Pick a new stack.<br /></li>
<li>Learn it.<br /></li>
<li>Build a network.</li>
</ol>


<br />


<br />


<p>Picking a stack is not an easy thing to do, but I have good news for you: once you master these steps, you won&rsquo;t ever be stuck again. No matter which one you pick, when the time comes, you will be able to quickly move way ahead of the pack. Don’t worry about trying to pick the one that will last your whole career, since, (and this may come as a shock to you) it probably won&rsquo;t last you a decade! That&rsquo;s why we should love software development, for the fast pace! If you want a job that never changes, go be a <del>librarian</del> <del>doctor</del> <del>lawyer</del> gardener.</p>

<br />


<br />


<p>Which language should you pick? You have two big categories to choose from that I suggest:</p>

<ul>
    <li dir="ltr">The popular</li>
    <li dir="ltr">The exotic</li>
</ul>


<br />


<p>The popular languages have significantly more, and a greater variety of jobs. On the down side, you also have more competition from other developers, and most of them have been using that language since before they were born. To stand out here, you need something to differentiate yourself from the other candidates: a unique perspective, skill in another programming paradigm, an ability to quickly learn new things, rapidly change contexts, etc. Figure out what your unique contributions are, and communicate them clearly.</p>

<br />


<br />


<p>Alternatively, on the exotic route, you pick an up-and-coming language, the new hotness, as it were. Because it is so new, there are much fewer jobs in this language, and less long-term stability. Consequently, there are also much fewer experienced developers. Savvy companies using this language will hire interested developers, despite them lacking any experience with it. (All your hard work in step two will really pay off here.)</p>

<br />


<br />


<p>Having chosen a language, now it’s time to learn it! Fill your github with work in that language.
 Read some books on it. Look for ways to use it at your current job. If your situation allows, start a big side project in it. You don&rsquo;t HAVE to open-source the code on github, but this certainly helps to publicize your learning. Companies seek prior job experience to avoid having to pay to train you; well then, beat them to the punch by already knowing it!</p>

<br />


<br />


<p>To build your network, go to meetups and get involved in them. I cannot emphasize this enough.
 Stick out your hand and introduce yourself. Make connections with the people you meet. Learn about the tools people use at their work. You will begin to think like a developer in that stack as you’re exposed to new concepts. Soon enough, you will develop a sense of what companies are hiring and who would give you a recommendation at their company.</p>

<br />


<br />


<p>Mind your attitude when interviewing. Resist the urge to cynically compare and contrast the old and new stacks. I have interviewed too many candidates who could not stop talking about how great their old language is, or how “these new hipster languages are just a fad”. While you are certainly always entitled to your opinion, (who knows, you may even be right!), carrying on like this in an interview setting never leaves a good impression.</p>

<br />


<br />


<p>Perhaps you’re thinking that this is just too much effort. Just like everything in life, choosing not to move is also a valid move. I like to call it &ldquo;riding into the sunset&rdquo;. In this option, you never leave your language, ever. Though this may feel like the safer choice right now, it carries its own risks. If you hate maintenance projects, you need to learn to love them, because they are going to be your bread and butter. But, you will be competing for these projects with all the other sunsetters, and there are going to be a lot of them. From what I have heard, however, once you have reached the point where there are more maintenance jobs than there are remaining developers, you really do get to write your own ticket, but this can take decades. My great uncle did this, and he managed to stay employed in COBOL till he retired.</p>

<br />


<br />


<p>While escaping from your stack requires effort, by following the steps you can achieve it in just a few hours a week. So, get out there and do it!</p>
