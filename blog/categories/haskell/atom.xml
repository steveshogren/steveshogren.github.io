    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to make a model that predicts bugs.</p>

<p>I previously wrote a table for scoring language safety:
<a href="http://deliberate-software.com/programming-language-safety-algorithm/">Programming Language Safety Score</a>,
but it was extremely time consuming to score new languages or make modifications.</p>

<h2>Simplify, Simplify</h2>

<p>After being told I was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">overfitting</a>
the data, I&rsquo;ve attempted to clean up by simply checking if each category is
enforced, possible, or impossible. I score each as either 1 (language enforced),
0 (possible, but you have to remember to do it), or -1 (impossible). When the
magnitudes of the new model are compared with the previous model, they come out
very similar. The shape of the curve pretty much stays the same, which I was
told indicates that the character count weighting was a variable that didn&rsquo;t
matter.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rplot.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The code I used to generate the plot and normalize the scores can be found here:
<a href="https://github.com/steveshogren/datasciencecoursera/blob/817dec79e36b6e9a6c5a8fd5700aff7cc394b9d4/scoreplot.R">scorePlot.R</a></p>

<h2>Safety Definitions</h2>

<p>A definition of the safety checks is as follows:</p>

<p><div ng-app="TableApp2">
<div ng-controller="TableCtrl">
<table class="langtable">
<tr><th>Check</th> <th>Description</th></tr>
<tr ng-repeat="check in langChecks">
<td> {{ check.name }} </td>
<td>  {{ check.desc }}  </td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>The new scores are shown here, with a lot more languages added in:</p>

<p><p class="lead">
<div style="overflow-x:scroll">
<table class="langtable">
<tr>
<th>Safety Check</th>
<th></th>
<th>
<select ng-options="getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="languages[0]"></select>
</th>
<th>
<select ng-options="getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="languages[1]"></select>
</th>
<th>
<select ng-options="getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="languages[2]"></select>
</th>
<th>
<select ng-options="getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="languages[3]"></select>
</th>
</tr>
<tr ng-repeat="check in langChecks" score-row name="check.name" row-key="check.key"></tr>
<tr class="totals"><td>Totals</td>
<td></td>
<td ng-repeat="lang in langTotals track by $index">
 {{ lang }} 
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="totals"><td>Magnitude</td>
<td></td>
<td ng-repeat="lang in langTotals track by $index">
 {{ percentageTotals(lang) }}% 
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div></p>

<p>Current Languages:
<span ng-repeat="lang in allLanguages">
 {{ getName(lang) }}: {{ allLangTotals[$index] }}, 
</select></p>

<h2>So, What&rsquo;s the Point?</h2>

<p>To see how this model corresponds with data in the real world, I used the GitHub
API to query for the number of bugs created in repositories with more than 15
forks created in a span from 2011 to 2015. Commits were counted by summing the
commit counts of all contributors.</p>

<p>I decided to rely on the count of commits as a standard for a unit of work. My
assumption was that across fifty different projects, the commit sizes would
average out. Once the unit of work was decided on, I wanted to find the ratio of
bugs per commit for each language.</p>

<p>I collected the ratio of bugs logged per commit for each repository, and after
grouping by primary language, removed the top and bottom 25% using the
bug/commit ratio, which is a common practice in statistics to help find a more
accurate average. I summed the bugs and commits of those remaining repositories
grouped by language, finding a total average bug/commit ratio for each language
grouping. Here is that data, sorted by safety score.</p>

<p><table class="langtable">
<tr><th>Language</th>
<th>Bugs</th>
<th>Commits</th>
<th>Repositories</th>
<th>Bug/Commits</th>
<tr ng-repeat="lang in languageRatios">
<td> {{ lang.name }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.bugs }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.commits }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.repos }} </td>
<td> {{ getBugsRatio(lang) }} </td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>Here are the languages sorted by safety score with bug/commit ratios:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/errorChart.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" >
<img class="center" src="/images/bugsAverage.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I took the magnitude of the safety scores and the bug/commit ratios. After
inverting the safety scores, I overlaid them both onto a single graph.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/bothMags.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Immediately it is obvious that Ruby, Python, PHP, and Clojure all seem to strongly
buck the trend, but otherwise the languages follow a pretty consistent slope
down in bugs. Taking the correlation gives a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient">correlation coefficient</a>
of .55</p>

<h2>What About Unit Tests?</h2>

<p>Thinking that Ruby, Clojure, PHP, and Python might not correlate well due to some
other factor, I collected data on how many tests each repository had. I counted
the number of files containing &ldquo;test&rdquo; or &ldquo;spec&rdquo;, which gave the following,
sorted by tests per commit:</p>

<p><table class="langtable">
<tr><th>Language</th>
<th>Tests</th>
<th>Commits</th>
<th>Repositories</th>
<th>Tests/Commits</th></tr>
<tr ng-repeat="lang in sorter(languageRatios)">
<td> {{ lang.name }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.test }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.commits }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.repos }} </td>
<td> {{ getTestsRatio(lang) }} </td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>PHP, Python, and Ruby all have a higher then average number of tests, but
Clojure does not. Additionally, Go, Scala, and Java all also have a higher than
average number of tests, yet they score relatively average in bugs/commit.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, the current safety model I have proposed seems to account for a
moderate reduction in bugs per commit across the sampled languages, but is not
the only factor. It currently is unable to account for a significantly lower
than expected bug count in Ruby and Clojure.</p>

<h2>Complaints Department</h2>

<p>Did I mess up something about a language here, or am I missing a safety check? I&rsquo;ll happily take pull
requests for new languages:
<a href="https://github.com/steveshogren/blog-source/blob/master/source/javascripts/sliders2.js">blog source</a>. Just
pick an existing language, edit the name and values, and &ldquo;copy to clipboard&rdquo; to
build your own language data structure. Send it to me in a PR and I&rsquo;ll include
it along with a thanks on the page.</p>

<p><div ng-show="showRealName">
<h2>Select Language:
<select ng-options="lang.name for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="selectedLang"></select>
<button ng-click="copyToClipboard(selectedLang)">Copy Changes to Clipboard</button>
</h2>
<h2><input ng-model="selectedLang.name"></input></h2>
<table class="langtable">
<tr><th>Check</th><th>Option</th></tr>
<tr ng-repeat="check in langChecks">
<td style="background-color: {{scoreClass(score(selectedLang[check.key]))}} ">
 {{ check.name }}:  {{score(selectedLang[check.key]) }} 
</td>
