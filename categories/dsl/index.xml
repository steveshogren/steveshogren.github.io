      <description>Trigger warning: this is a silly rant I wrote a few years ago after raging at the Hugo blog engine for a couple hours. I think its funny and still relevant, so hyperbolic nonsense incoming!
DSL&amp;rsquo;s (Domain Specific Languages) are often terrible. Each DSL is a special snowflake, delicately floating from the heavens straight into in your eye.
The problem with a DSL is that it always starts so simple. You take a complex problem and represent it simply with some nice pretty syntax.</description>
