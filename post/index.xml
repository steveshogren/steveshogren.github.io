      <title>Wrangling State In Haskell</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Part 2 of my series &amp;ldquo;Wrangling State&amp;rdquo;. Part 1
&lt;a href=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/clojure-state/&#34;&gt;Wrangling State In Clojure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haskell is a pure language, so you can only deal with application state by
passing parameters to functions. It is possible to pass parameters more
conveniently, but ultimately, every parameter needs to be passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple application for logging a timestamp to a file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;Pass As Parameter&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-haskell&#34;&gt;loadFile :: Filename -&amp;gt; IO String
loadFile fileName =
  BS.unpack &amp;lt;$&amp;gt; Str.readFile fileName

saveFile :: Filename -&amp;gt; String -&amp;gt; IO ()
saveFile fileName contents = 
  Str.writeFile fileName (BS.pack contents)

clearFile :: Filename -&amp;gt; IO ()
clearFile fileName = saveFile fileName &amp;quot;&amp;quot;

appendToFile :: Filename -&amp;gt; String -&amp;gt; IO ()
appendToFile fileName stuff = do
    contents &amp;lt;- loadFile fileName
    saveFile fileName (contents++stuff)

main fileName &amp;quot;-c&amp;quot; = clearFile fileName
main fileName &amp;quot;-log&amp;quot; = do
  now &amp;lt;- getCurrentTime
  appendToFile fileName ((show now)++ &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take in the file name and the command to perform, either to clear the file or
to append a new timestamp. While simple, this gets cumbersome in a large
application. Imagine passing a database connection through every single function
that eventually calls the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haskell can have implicit parameters that are not defined in the argument list.
Sometimes this can improve legibility, other times it can worsen it. To use this
feature, the function signature must contain the value missing. The parameter(s)
must be the &amp;ldquo;last&amp;rdquo; parameter(s) to the function for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the same code with &lt;strong&gt;Implicit Parameters&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-haskell&#34;&gt;loadFile :: Filename -&amp;gt; IO String
loadFile = (liftM BS.unpack) . Str.readFile

saveFile :: String -&amp;gt; Filename -&amp;gt; IO ()
saveFile contents fileName =
  Str.writeFile fileName (BS.pack contents)

clearFile :: Filename -&amp;gt; IO ()
clearFile = saveFile &amp;quot;&amp;quot;

appendToFile :: String -&amp;gt; Filename -&amp;gt; IO ()
appendToFile stuff fileName = do
    contents &amp;lt;- loadFile fileName
    saveFile (contents++stuff) fileName

main fileName &amp;quot;-c&amp;quot; = clearFile fileName
main fileName &amp;quot;-log&amp;quot; = do
  now &amp;lt;- getCurrentTime
  appendToFile ((show now)++ &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;) fileName
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all usages of &lt;code&gt;Filename&lt;/code&gt; could be made implicit. We did use it in
&lt;code&gt;loadFile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;clearFile&lt;/code&gt;. It does allow the &amp;ldquo;differences&amp;rdquo; to stand out
more. For example, &lt;code&gt;clearFile&lt;/code&gt; is just a &lt;code&gt;saveFile&lt;/code&gt; with an empty string
for the first parameter. We can see the differences clearly without the extra
parameter adding noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could not add it to &lt;code&gt;appendToFile&lt;/code&gt; because it uses the &lt;code&gt;Filename&lt;/code&gt;
more than once, or &lt;code&gt;saveFile&lt;/code&gt; because it is not the &amp;ldquo;last&amp;rdquo; parameter to &lt;code&gt;Str.writeFile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it is possible to encode such values into the type. The type of the
function itself can imply a value that can be retrieved. For example, the Reader
type can be combined with the IO type using ReaderT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the code using the &lt;strong&gt;Reader Type&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-haskell&#34;&gt;loadFile :: ReaderT Filename IO String
loadFile = do
  fileName &amp;lt;- ask
  liftIO $ BS.unpack &amp;lt;$&amp;gt; Str.readFile fileName

saveFile :: String -&amp;gt; ReaderT Filename IO ()
saveFile contents = do
  fileName &amp;lt;- ask
  liftIO $ Str.writeFile fileName (BS.pack contents)

clearFile :: ReaderT Filename IO ()
clearFile = saveFile &amp;quot;&amp;quot;

appendToFile :: String -&amp;gt; ReaderT Filename IO ()
appendToFile stuff = do
    contents &amp;lt;- loadFile
    saveFile (contents++stuff)

main fileName &amp;quot;-c&amp;quot; = runReaderT clearFile fileName
main fileName &amp;quot;-log&amp;quot; = do
  now &amp;lt;- getCurrentTime
  runReaderT (appendToFile ((show now)++ &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;)) fileName
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice now how &lt;code&gt;appendToFile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;clearFile&lt;/code&gt; have the signature:
&lt;code&gt;ReaderT Filename IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, indicating that anything below them can &lt;code&gt;ask&lt;/code&gt;
for the Filename, while still performing an &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; action. The &amp;ldquo;entry-point&amp;rdquo;
calls in &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; need to be initialized with the &lt;code&gt;runReaderT&lt;/code&gt; and the
&lt;code&gt;Filename&lt;/code&gt; we want to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this case, the &lt;code&gt;ReaderT&lt;/code&gt; is substantially more readable. The &amp;ldquo;business
value&amp;rdquo; functions &lt;code&gt;appendToFile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;clearFile&lt;/code&gt; do not have to define
and pass the parameters needed for the lower level functions &lt;code&gt;saveFile&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;loadFile&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Reader Type&lt;/strong&gt; gives us the value of the &lt;strong&gt;Implicit
Parameters&lt;/strong&gt; for legibility!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For something like a database connection that might be used pervasively, the
&lt;strong&gt;Reader Type&lt;/strong&gt; is essential for legible code. The low level functions that need
the &lt;code&gt;Filename&lt;/code&gt; are able to call &lt;code&gt;ask&lt;/code&gt; to retrieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Dependencies&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Complexity&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Adding New State&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Best When&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pass As Parameter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Explicit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Less Complex&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Harder&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;State only needed in a few functions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implicit Parameter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Explicit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Less Complex&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Harder&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Functions can be made more readable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reader Type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Explicit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;More Complex&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Easier&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;State needed throughout the application&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/clojure-state/&#34;&gt;Clojure version&lt;/a&gt;
of this chart, the Haskell one has no way to call a function &amp;ldquo;incorrectly&amp;rdquo;. All
in-memory state is passed explicitly. It is still possible to pass as any
parameter a value that is invalid. The explicit nature of Haskell parameters
does not prevent passing a database connection string that does not exist, or a
pointer to an incorrectly setup data structure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hot Loading Angular2 With State</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/figwheel-angular2/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://deliberate-software.com/figwheel-angular2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/cljs-angular2/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Using Angular2 in Clojurescript&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
I showed how to get ClojureScript to run an Angular2 template. Basic hotswapping
worked, but state was lost on each load. Tweaking the original demo allows for
figwheel to swap in the template without losing client state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a demo of hotswapping with state preservation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/images/hotswap.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this demo, we add three things to a list, then change the template that draws
the list. The client state stays in the browser, while the template changes
around it! Amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get this working, follow the steps in the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/cljs-angular2/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Using Angular2 in Clojurescript&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; first post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace the env/dev/cljs/dev.cljs contents with this simpler reloader:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34;&gt;(defn mount-component []
  ((.. js/ng -platform -browser -bootstrap)
   (.-AppComponent (.-app js/window))))

(figwheel/watch-and-reload :websocket-url &amp;quot;ws://localhost:3449/figwheel-ws&amp;quot;
                           :on-jsload mount-component)

(defonce only-attach-listener-once
  (.addEventListener js/document &amp;quot;DOMContentLoaded&amp;quot; mount-component))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now only re-mount the component on figwheel notification. The state is moved
to an atom in the core namespace like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34;&gt;(defn get-app []
   (or (.-app js/window)
       (set! (.-app js/window) #js {})))

;; keep state of the component in a defonce atom
(defonce heroes (atom []))

(let [app (get-app)
      c (.Component (.-core js/ng)
                    #js {:selector &amp;quot;my-app&amp;quot;
                         :template (html [:div
                                          [:h1 &amp;quot; Demo&amp;quot;]
                                          [:div [:h2 &amp;quot;Hero List:&amp;quot;]]
                                          &amp;quot;
&amp;lt;input #newHero (keyup.enter)=\&amp;quot;addHero(newHero.value); newHero.value=&#39;&#39; \&amp;quot; &amp;gt;
&amp;lt;button (click)=\&amp;quot;addHero(newHero.value); newHero.value=&#39;&#39; \&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Add&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li *ngFor=\&amp;quot;#hero of heroes()\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{hero}}&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;quot;
                                          ])})
      c (.Class c #js {:constructor (fn [])
                       :addHero (fn [hero]
                                  (swap! heroes #(conj % hero)))
                       :heroes (fn [] @heroes)
                       })]
  (set! (.-AppComponent app) c))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site now will recompile and reload while preserving the state of the
component. This pattern can be extended to allow certain state to be preserved
while other state is reloaded. In this demo, the state in the &lt;code&gt;#newHero&lt;/code&gt;
field is not preserved, while the &lt;code&gt;heroes&lt;/code&gt; list is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great story for using hiccups to generate the special angular
tags like &lt;code&gt;*ngFor&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(click)&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;(keyup.enter)&lt;/code&gt;. For this demo, I
left that html as just a raw string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the full working example on GitHub &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/steveshogren/angular2-cljs/tree/5025e2983ab054c88717c89528b85c7f9aaea851&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Angular2 in ClojureScript</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/cljs-angular2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://deliberate-software.com/cljs-angular2/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Getting ClojureScript to run Angular2 is not very difficult. Here is a sample
project demonstrating a working Angular2 site using Figwheel for hot-reloading
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/steveshogren/angular2-cljs/tree/ae1a1abfe91a84cb5146931ff731885a2b1d5486&#34;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-install-luminus-cljs:468cef4ba8bc346f91f6a6d4062843b7&#34;&gt;1. Install Luminus +cljs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, setup a basic ClojureScript site using Luminus starter template from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luminusweb.net/docs&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;lein new luminus cljs-angular2 +cljs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This builds a great basic starter project with ClojureScript and figwheel
already running. The template uses Reagent and React, which are excellent, but
we want Angular2!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-replace-figwheel-site-loader:468cef4ba8bc346f91f6a6d4062843b7&#34;&gt;2. Replace Figwheel Site Loader&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the env/dev/cljs/dev.cljs file, which starts the site when running from
development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace the call to start a figwheel watcher with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojurescript&#34;&gt;(defn reload []
  (core/init!)
  ((.. js/ng -platform -browser -bootstrap)
   (.-AppComponent (.-app js/window))))

(figwheel/watch-and-reload :websocket-url &amp;quot;ws://localhost:3449/figwheel-ws&amp;quot;
                           :on-jsload reload)

(core/init!)
(defonce only-attach-listener-once
  (.addEventListener js/document &amp;quot;DOMContentLoaded&amp;quot;
                     (fn []
                       ((.. js/ng -platform -browser -bootstrap)
                        (.-AppComponent (core/get-app))))))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defonce will make sure I accidentally don&amp;rsquo;t attach the same event listener
twice when re-evaluating files at the repl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-make-angular2-component:468cef4ba8bc346f91f6a6d4062843b7&#34;&gt;3. Make Angular2 Component&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace the src-cljs/cljs-angular2/core.cljs file with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojurescript&#34;&gt;(ns cljs-angular2.core
  (:require-macros [hiccups.core :as hiccups :refer [html]]))

(defn get-app []
   (or (.-app js/window)
       (set! (.-app js/window) #js {})))

(defn init! []
  (let [app (get-app)
        c (.Component (.-core js/ng)
                      #js {:selector &amp;quot;my-app&amp;quot;
                           :template (html [:div
                                            [:h1 &amp;quot;My first Angular 2 app&amp;quot;]
                                            [:div [:h2 &amp;quot;test&amp;quot;]]
                                            [:div [:h3 &amp;quot;test2&amp;quot;]]])})
        c (.Class c #js {:constructor (fn [])})]
    (set! (.-AppComponent app) c)))

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-add-angular2-dependencies:468cef4ba8bc346f91f6a6d4062843b7&#34;&gt;4. Add Angular2 Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a package.json file into resources/public/ and fill it with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;angular2-quickstart&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;version&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1.0.0&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;start&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;npm run lite&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;lite&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;lite-server&amp;quot;
  },
  &amp;quot;license&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ISC&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;dependencies&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;angular2&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2.0.0-beta.14&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;es6-shim&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^0.35.0&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;reflect-metadata&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0.1.2&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;rxjs&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;5.0.0-beta.2&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;zone.js&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0.6.6&amp;quot;
  },
  &amp;quot;devDependencies&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;concurrently&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^2.0.0&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;lite-server&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^2.2.0&amp;quot;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now run &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; from inside the resources/public directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-add-hiccups:468cef4ba8bc346f91f6a6d4062843b7&#34;&gt;5. Add Hiccups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify the project.clj in the root directory to include the &lt;code&gt;hiccups&lt;/code&gt;
dependency so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to write nasty html strings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34;&gt;:dependencies [[hiccups &amp;quot;0.3.0&amp;quot;]
               ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-add-dependencies-to-home-html:468cef4ba8bc346f91f6a6d4062843b7&#34;&gt;6. Add Dependencies To Home HTML&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following to resources/templates/home.html before the line including
&lt;code&gt;{% script &amp;quot;/js/app.js&amp;quot; %}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;my-app&amp;gt;Loading...&amp;lt;/my-app&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;node_modules/es6-shim/es6-shim.min.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;node_modules/angular2/es6/dev/src/testing/shims_for_IE.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;node_modules/angular2/bundles/angular2-polyfills.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;node_modules/rxjs/bundles/Rx.umd.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;node_modules/angular2/bundles/angular2-all.umd.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-start-site:468cef4ba8bc346f91f6a6d4062843b7&#34;&gt;7. Start Site!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the site with three tabs open running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;lein run
lein cljsbuild auto
lein figwheel
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;lein run&lt;/code&gt; command should emit a line showing the port number like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2016-04-10 16:16:51,326][INFO][cljs-angular2.core] server started on port: 3000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just open your browser to &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000&lt;/code&gt; where 3000 is the port number
from the &lt;code&gt;lein run&lt;/code&gt; command. Try to modify the core.cljs file to have a new
template, and the site should automatically refresh with the new changes! If
that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, make sure you are running both the cljsbuild on auto and
figwheel processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy as that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get stuck, I checked in a working version &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/steveshogren/angular2-cljs/tree/ae1a1abfe91a84cb5146931ff731885a2b1d5486&#34;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wrangling State In Clojure</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/clojure-state/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://deliberate-software.com/clojure-state/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Clojure is immutable, so you can&amp;rsquo;t change anything, how useless!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immutable languages make application state an interesting concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Clojure, you can deal with application state in two main ways. The first way
is to pass the state around as parameters to your functions. An example of
&lt;strong&gt;Pass As Parameter&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34;&gt;(defn delete! [db-con table id]
  (jdbc/delete! db-con table [&amp;quot;id=?&amp;quot; id]))

;; valid-for-delete omitted

(defn delete-user [db-con user-id]
  (if (valid-for-delete db-con &amp;quot;user&amp;quot; user-id)
    (delete! db-con &amp;quot;user&amp;quot; user-id)))

(defn -main [&amp;amp; [connection-string user-id]]
  (let [db-con (make-connection connection-string)]
    (delete-user db-con user-id)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires every function that eventually accesses a database to also have
the database connection. The trade-off is one of simplicity: it is easier to
test and interact with code that takes all of its dependencies as parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative is to set a thread-safe value somewhere and give the underlying
code access to it. In Clojure, the &lt;code&gt;atom&lt;/code&gt; primitive is the first choice for
this. A common misconception is that Clojure prevents all mutation. The
&lt;code&gt;atom&lt;/code&gt; primitive can be mutated, it just has to be done with a special
&lt;code&gt;swap!&lt;/code&gt; function. Let&amp;rsquo;s call this: &lt;strong&gt;Mutate Shared Location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-clojure&#34;&gt;(def db-con (atom nil))

(defn delete! [table id]
  (jdbc/delete! @db-con table [&amp;quot;id=?&amp;quot; id]))

;; valid-for-delete omitted

(defn delete-user [user-id]
  (if (valid-for-delete &amp;quot;user&amp;quot; user-id)
    (delete! &amp;quot;user&amp;quot; user-id)))

(defn -main [&amp;amp; [connection-string user-id]]
  (swap! db-con (fn [old] (make-connection connection-string)))
  (delete-user user-id))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;atom&lt;/code&gt; allows us to not have to pass around the state. We mutate
&lt;code&gt;db-con&lt;/code&gt; with the connection parameters before calling any database accessing
functions. Unfortunately, this sets up an implicit dependency: &lt;code&gt;delete!&lt;/code&gt;
will only work if the &lt;code&gt;db-con&lt;/code&gt; atom was setup beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Dependencies&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Correctly Call Function&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Adding New State&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Best When&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pass As Parameter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Explicit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Easier&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Harder&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;State Values Change Frequently&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutate Shared Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Implicit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Harder&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Easier&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;State Values Change Rarely&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutate Shared Location&lt;/strong&gt; might look familiar, in a lot of other languages it
is implemented with the Singleton Design Pattern. Often a Singleton class will
act as the mutable shared location for storing state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When adding new application state, I typically default to &lt;strong&gt;Pass As Parameter&lt;/strong&gt;
as my first choice. When &lt;strong&gt;Pass As Parameter&lt;/strong&gt; grows costly, I fall back to
&lt;strong&gt;Mutate Shared Location&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Pass As Parameter&lt;/strong&gt; works best when the value
changes regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exception would be something as ubiquitous as a database connection in a CRUD
application. A CRUD application will typically need a database connection at
every leaf node, and it rarely changes, so I will use &lt;strong&gt;Mutate Shared Location&lt;/strong&gt;
from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these two ways of passing application state, we are offered the flexibility
to choose the best tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When Self-Organizing Teams Are Effective</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/self-organizing-teams/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://deliberate-software.com/self-organizing-teams/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Great, now instead of programmers, we are politicians&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A self-organizing team can be one of the most effective ways to build a team of
high-quality professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-self-organizing-team:c36738b5d4cff136bd50ed28a796f49d&#34;&gt;What Is A Self-Organizing Team?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have managed several self-organizing teams over the last few years. They are
expected to follow these tenets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The whole team organizes themselves to best meet the business needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each team chooses their practices and working agreements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All technical and organizational decisions are driven through consensus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product owners determine &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; happens, the team determines &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All staff participates in a culture of high-quality development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systems and practices are designed to maintain the greatest productivity across
the next decade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-it-works-well:c36738b5d4cff136bd50ed28a796f49d&#34;&gt;When It Works Well&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly skilled workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need for high-quality software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business need for continuous and stable productivity for 5+ years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy-in from management that &amp;ldquo;productivity is worth feeling out of control&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-organizing teams work best when most people on your team are eager to do
more, be more, and learn more. A team of such developers will find a single
leader to be a bottleneck. Running every idea past a single decision maker will
impair their abilities to grow and gain critical thinking skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study:c36738b5d4cff136bd50ed28a796f49d&#34;&gt;Case Study&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently lead a self-organizing team of ten developers. We alone actively
develop in a 4.6 million line codebase. The codebase is over 10 years old, and
the entire team has turned over twice since the project started. This is no
maintenance project, this quarter we converted the main calculation engine
(~600KLOC) to allow calculations to be parallelized across dozens of nodes for a
substantial increase in throughput.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team has recently been recognized as producing the most business value with
the highest quality across our +700 person software company. Our CEO and SVP of
Product have highlighted our recent accolades. I am certain this was only
possible because of the intrinsic motivation of our staff caused by
self-organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actively develop in a 10 year old codebase sized at ~460KLOC per developer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deciding on working agreements, the original team voted on strict
pair-programming, frequent pair switches
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://csis.pace.edu/~grossman/dcs/XR4-PromiscuousPairing.pdf&#34;&gt;promiscuous pairing&lt;/a&gt;),
and test-driven development. Each subsequent iteration of the team has continued
to vote for these agreements. We believe that it is one of the easiest ways to
keep a team capable in such an enormous codebase. Randomized pairing and 2-8
hour switching prevents siloing of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any other company, our least experienced developers would be team leads and
architects; and our most experienced developers would be CTO&amp;rsquo;s. They&amp;rsquo;ve gotten
this experience by living it. In case you think we&amp;rsquo;ve hired a team of seasoned
graybeards, our average developer only has six years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each member of our team is responsible for &amp;ldquo;being the lead&amp;rdquo; in certain ways. The
individual&amp;rsquo;s own interests guide them to develop expertise in subjects. By being
an expert, others listen to them, so they often have an attentive audience when
speaking on their specialties. This positive feedback loop encourages additional
research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-start:c36738b5d4cff136bd50ed28a796f49d&#34;&gt;How to Start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; The most important way to build such a team is to allow them to fail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team must be allowed to face the consequences of their actions in a safe
space. If a refactoring project goes badly, the team should have the individual
clean up their mess. When someone is spending time on a project that doesn&amp;rsquo;t
align with the goals of the business, the team should speak with them. When a
developer successfully campaigns for a change that increases productivity, it
should be celebrated. In all cases, strive to have your office be a safe place
to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time someone in authority demands the team do something different, it
reduces the intrinsic motivation of the team. Each demand teaches the team
members that they don&amp;rsquo;t have to be responsible, someone else will take care of
the &amp;ldquo;important&amp;rdquo; things for them. Treat such demands with the utmost care, only
making demands extremely infrequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Fewer demands allows for greater intrinsic motivation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A self-organizing team is very much like a democracy. The team is expected and
entrusted to organize around the needs of the business. Decisions should be made
by consensus. Very rarely should an &amp;ldquo;override&amp;rdquo; be needed from management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion:c36738b5d4cff136bd50ed28a796f49d&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-organizing teams are one of the most effective ways to manage a
high-performing group. The team benefits from the best aspects of each member.
Team members &amp;ldquo;grow up&amp;rdquo; quickly, as they are exposed to others around them who
behave like trusted professionals. Each developer becomes intrinsically
motivated, outperforming their peers in similar command and control teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;replies:c36738b5d4cff136bd50ed28a796f49d&#34;&gt;Replies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lobste.rs/u/petergao&#34;&gt;PeterGao&lt;/a&gt; on lobste.rs
&lt;a href=&#34;https://lobste.rs/s/1fhkxo/when_self-organizing_teams_are_effective/comments/e3niex#c_e3niex&#34;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;
that undergrad school projects often see everyone grouping by skill, with all
the best in a group together. I too have had bad luck with undergrad CS school
projects, especially since at the time I was a C-performer. School projects mix
a fairly homogeneous group of immature students with a subtly different goal:
“pick a few other people, your work will be compared to everyone else’s”.
Self-selected grouping by skill makes sense, it’s effectively a competition. One
of the recommended alterations for group projects is “your grade is the average
grade of all the group projects”. Suddenly, you won’t see those teams separating
by skill. Instead students will organize with a team mix as even as possible,
with cross-communication (and likely rotation) happening to ensure high quality
across all the projects. Bam, now you’ve got my office ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Avoid Pop Culture Architecture</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/pop-culture-architecture/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://deliberate-software.com/pop-culture-architecture/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;ActiveRecord is so hot right now!&amp;rdquo; - comment in 2006&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pop Culture Architecture is the current &amp;ldquo;fad&amp;rdquo; of the day. I have seen it be
microservices, business capabilities, CQRS, service-oriented architecture,
Domain-Driven Design, test driven development, ORMs, ActiveRecord, and MVC. Each
of these have been fashionable at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fashion is ultimately a signaling mechanism for status. We are attracted to
fashionable architectures because they signal we have worked on elite teams. The
more difficult or costly the trade-offs of the architecture, the more elite and
special our team must have been to implement it successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-microservices:5f95d372c851097c31e5c149858c384a&#34;&gt;Example: Microservices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microservices is a current fashionable design. Microservices have very clear
pros and cons. They come with the ability to have a huge team or a fragmented
deployment that potentially allows for horizontal scaling. For that ability, you
will pay the immense costs: loss of strong consistency and transactions, a
labyrinthine operational footprint and deployment, increased communication
effort, expensive integration testing, and a code base that takes longer to
program. &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html&#34;&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a small team or system that does not need horizontal scaling on
every single component, a microservice architecture is unlikely to solve your
communication or trust issues. You will spend dollars on deployment, consistency
issues, distributed debugging, and basic programming just to save a penny on
communication and teamwork.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stackbuilders.com/news/the-hidden-costs-of-microservices&#34;&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most teams, the logical conclusion probably will be: a microservice
architecture solves problems we don&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microservices remain fashionable because they indicate work at the size and
scale of a handful of elite companies. You would only likely encounter a couple
hundred companies in the world that have a development staff so large or loads
so high as to truly require such a system. Because of the rarity of actual need,
it is a perfect signaling mechanism for status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that you implemented a microservice architecture implies &amp;ldquo;my team was so
large or my product so popular, my team could afford to pay almost any cost to
meet the demand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carefully consider your architecture decisions. Do not allow fashion to dictate
your choices. Take pride in selecting the appropriate architecture for the
project, no matter how unpopular.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Haskell is the Dark Souls of Programming</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/haskell-is-the-dark-souls-of-programming/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://deliberate-software.com/haskell-is-the-dark-souls-of-programming/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;rsquo;t hit me, Haskell does a great job of that already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Haskell for the same reasons I love Dark Souls. Fantastic and inscrutable
lore, a great &lt;del&gt;combat&lt;/del&gt; type system, a cliff-wall difficulty curve, and
unending punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to collect some statistics from the GitHub API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-one-stack:6807ae504e3906e54fafcf1fb117cd62&#34;&gt;Step One - Stack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I download stack and start a project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; cd /home/jack/programming &amp;amp;&amp;amp; stack new github-stats &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd github-stats
Downloading template &amp;quot;new-template&amp;quot; to create project &amp;quot;github-stats&amp;quot; in github-stats/ ... 
 ......
All done.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good. Does it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;  &amp;gt; stack build &amp;amp;&amp;amp; stack exec -- github-stats-exe 
   github-stats-0.1.0.0: configure
   ..... 
   Registering github-stats-0.1.0.0...
   someFunc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awww yisss. This is going to be so easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-two-https-get-request:6807ae504e3906e54fafcf1fb117cd62&#34;&gt;Step Two - HTTPS GET Request&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/images/tomb_of_the_giants.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I need to query the GitHub API. Not my first time to the rodeo, I generate a
personal access token from GitHub and copy it to a local file. What query should
I run first? How about the count for all ASM tetris repositories? Poking around
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-repositories&#34;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; comes up
with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=tetris+language:assembly&amp;amp;sort=stars&amp;amp;order=desc
User-Agent: steveshogren
Authorization: token PUT_TOKEN_HERE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{.. &amp;ldquo;total_count&amp;rdquo;: 354}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy life. Now how do you GET a resource in Haskell? Ah,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HTTP-4000.3.2/docs/Network-HTTP.html&#34;&gt;Network.HTTP&lt;/a&gt;!
I copy the front page sample into &lt;code&gt;src/Lib.hs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-haskell&#34;&gt;module Lib
    ( someFunc
    ) where

x = simpleHTTP (getRequest &amp;quot;https://www.github.com/&amp;quot;) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= fmap (take 100) . getResponseBody

someFunc :: IO ()
someFunc = 
   print x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So simple! This is why laugh at my NodeJS loving friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; stack build
src/Lib.hs:5:5: Not in scope: ‘simpleHTTP’
src/Lib.hs:5:17: Not in scope: ‘getRequest’
src/Lib.hs:5:77: Not in scope: ‘getResponseBody’
Compilation failed.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t compile. Durp, hackage is a package library, I need to add this to my
cabal. What is the name of the package? HTTP-4000? HTTP-4000.3.2? Nothing in
hackage seems to indicate what goes into the cabal file. I discover it is just
HTTP through trial and error. I update my cabal file&amp;hellip; in all three
build-depends&amp;hellip;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-haskell&#34;&gt;  build-depends:       base &amp;gt;= 4.7 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; &amp;lt; 5
                       , HTTP
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hrm, same error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; stack build
src/Lib.hs:5:5: Not in scope: ‘simpleHTTP’
src/Lib.hs:5:17: Not in scope: ‘getRequest’
src/Lib.hs:5:77: Not in scope: ‘getResponseBody’
Compilation failed.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, durp, I&amp;rsquo;d need an import. (WHY ISN&amp;rsquo;T THIS IN THE CODE SAMPLE?!) Also, print
doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, I need &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-haskell&#34;&gt;import Network.HTTP

x = simpleHTTP (getRequest &amp;quot;https://www.github.com/&amp;quot;) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= fmap (take 100) . getResponseBody

someFunc :: IO ()
someFunc = x &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= putStrLn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here goes!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt; &amp;gt; stack build &amp;amp;&amp;amp; stack exec -- github-stats-exe
github-stats-exe: user error (https not supported)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wat. Further inspection of the docs shows a line WAAY DOWN in paragraph 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This package only supports HTTP;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/images/nope_better.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;del&gt;playing Dark Souls&lt;/del&gt;programming Haskell, sometimes the best move
is to run away. I search again. &lt;code&gt;haskell https request&lt;/code&gt; returns
&amp;ldquo;http-conduit&amp;rdquo; as the best choice. After adding http-conduit to my cabal, I come
up with this beast without any surprises:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-haskell&#34;&gt;query :: IO String
query = do
    initReq &amp;lt;- parseUrl &amp;quot;https://api.github.com/search/repositories&amp;quot;
    let r = initReq
                   { method = &amp;quot;GET&amp;quot;

                                      , (hAuthorization, &amp;quot;token PUT_TOKEN_HERE&amp;quot;)]}
    let request = setQueryString [(&amp;quot;q&amp;quot;, Just &amp;quot;tetris+language:assembly&amp;quot;)
                                 ,(&amp;quot;order&amp;quot;, Just &amp;quot;desc&amp;quot;)
                                 ,(&amp;quot;sort&amp;quot;, Just &amp;quot;stars&amp;quot;)] r
    manager &amp;lt;- newManager tlsManagerSettings
    res &amp;lt;- httpLbs request manager
    return . show . responseBody $ res

someFunc :: IO ()
someFunc = do
   query &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= putStrLn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huzzah! Results! I&amp;rsquo;m getting back a monster string of json data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;\&amp;ldquo;{\\&amp;ldquo;total_count\\&amp;rdquo;:66, &amp;hellip;.}\&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-three-parsing-json:6807ae504e3906e54fafcf1fb117cd62&#34;&gt;Step Three - Parsing JSON&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to parse this mega JSON string. Aeson seems to be the biggest contender. To
use Aeson and get the total_count value from the return, I needed the following
additions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-haskell&#34;&gt;{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

import GHC.Generics
import Data.Aeson

data ResultCount = ResultCount {
  total_count :: Int }
  deriving (Generic, Show)

instance ToJSON ResultCount
instance FromJSON ResultCount
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ResultCount allows me to use &lt;code&gt;decode&lt;/code&gt; from aeson instead of &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; to
parse the &amp;ldquo;total_count&amp;rdquo; from the JSON response into an Int. Sure enough, it
does!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-haskell&#34;&gt;{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
module Lib
    ( someFunc
    ) where

import Control.Monad
import Network
import Network.HTTP.Conduit
import Network.HTTP.Types.Header
import GHC.Generics
import Data.Aeson

data ResultCount = ResultCount {
  total_count :: Int }
  deriving (Generic, Show)

instance ToJSON ResultCount
instance FromJSON ResultCount

query :: IO (Maybe Int)
query = do
    initReq &amp;lt;- parseUrl &amp;quot;https://api.github.com/search/repositories&amp;quot;
    let r = initReq
                   { method = &amp;quot;GET&amp;quot;
                    , requestHeaders = [(hUserAgent, &amp;quot;steveshogren&amp;quot;)
                                      , (hAuthorization, &amp;quot;token PUT_TOKEN_HERE&amp;quot;)]}
    let request = setQueryString [(&amp;quot;q&amp;quot;, Just &amp;quot;tetris+language:assembly&amp;quot;)
                                 ,(&amp;quot;order&amp;quot;, Just &amp;quot;desc&amp;quot;)
                                 ,(&amp;quot;sort&amp;quot;, Just &amp;quot;stars&amp;quot;)] r
    manager &amp;lt;- newManager tlsManagerSettings
    res &amp;lt;- httpLbs request manager
    return . liftM total_count . decode . responseBody $ res

someFunc :: IO ()
someFunc = query &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= print
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puts out: &lt;code&gt;Just 66&lt;/code&gt;. Success! Wait. 66 isn&amp;rsquo;t the same count I got when
running from the browser. Check again. Sure enough, browser comes up with a
totally different count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/images/come_at_me_bro.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the query request isn&amp;rsquo;t correct? Adding a &lt;code&gt;print request&lt;/code&gt; on line 31
after building the request shows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-haskell&#34;&gt;Request {
  host                 = &amp;quot;api.github.com&amp;quot;
  port                 = 443
  secure               = True
  requestHeaders       = [(&amp;quot;User-Agent&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;steveshogren&amp;quot;),(&amp;quot;Authorization&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;token PUT_TOKEN_HERE&amp;quot;)]
  path                 = &amp;quot;/search/repositories&amp;quot;
  queryString          = &amp;quot;?q=tetris%2Blanguage%3Aassembly&amp;amp;order=desc&amp;amp;sort=stars&amp;quot;
  method               = &amp;quot;GET&amp;quot;
  proxy                = Nothing
  rawBody              = False
  redirectCount        = 10
  responseTimeout      = Just (-3425)
  requestVersion       = HTTP/1.1
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The queryString isn&amp;rsquo;t right! It encoded my &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;! After an hour of
reading through docs and researching URL encoding specs, it dawns on me. &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;
is an encoded whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No face-palm gif could ever represent the shear magnitude of my current
emotions&amp;hellip; You&amp;rsquo;ll have to use your imagination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I change my query to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;tetris language:assembly&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and the right
count comes back! &lt;code&gt;Just 354&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally have something that correctly fetches a count of repositories from
GitHub and parses it into an Int. After over four hours of &lt;del&gt;Dark
Souls&lt;/del&gt;Haskell punishment, we deserve to enjoy a bonfire!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/images/solaire_sitting.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;edit-bonus-round:6807ae504e3906e54fafcf1fb117cd62&#34;&gt;Edit: Bonus Round!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to

and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/44hdl6/haskell_is_the_dark_souls_of_programming/czqaxfu&#34;&gt;/u/JeanParker&lt;/a&gt;
for pointing me towards &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.serpentine.com/wreq/&#34;&gt;wreq&lt;/a&gt;, which weirdly
didn&amp;rsquo;t come up when I looked around for libs yesterday. Yep, it was 6th on the
Google when searching for &lt;code&gt;haskell https get&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Network.HTTP&lt;/code&gt; is the
top three results, and that doesn&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; https.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¯\&lt;em&gt;(ツ)&lt;/em&gt;/¯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with their helpful suggestions, I knocked this out this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-haskell&#34;&gt;import Network.Wreq
import Control.Lens
import Data.Aeson
import Data.Aeson.Lens
import qualified Data.Text as T
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as BS

opts :: String -&amp;gt; String -&amp;gt; Options
opts lang token = defaults &amp;amp; param &amp;quot;q&amp;quot; .~ [T.pack $ &amp;quot;tetris language:&amp;quot; ++ lang]
                        &amp;amp; param &amp;quot;order&amp;quot; .~ [&amp;quot;desc&amp;quot;]
                        &amp;amp; param &amp;quot;sort&amp;quot; .~ [&amp;quot;stars&amp;quot;]
                        &amp;amp; header &amp;quot;Authorization&amp;quot; .~ [BS.pack $ &amp;quot;token &amp;quot; ++ token]

query lang = do
    token &amp;lt;- readFile &amp;quot;token&amp;quot;
    r &amp;lt;- getWith (opts lang token) &amp;quot;https://api.github.com/search/repositories&amp;quot;
    return $ r ^? responseBody . key &amp;quot;total_count&amp;quot; . _Number
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUCH better. This includes reading my token from file called &amp;ldquo;token&amp;rdquo; so I don&amp;rsquo;t
accidentally commit it. Also includes building up the different query options
based on inputs, which was the next step. Thanks y&amp;rsquo;all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Development Disappointment Disorder</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/development-disappointment-disorder/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve never had a successful release&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just finished this really hard feature. The whole thing was worse than
anyone realized. Not only that, but the feature wasn&amp;rsquo;t clearly explained, so you
lost time churning on the actual requirements. Despite all the confusion,
iteration, and technical challenges, you managed to get it working! You look
back, savoring how much you have learned and grown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You show it off to the product owner. He barely seems to hear you. His shoulders
slump in disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Great, but we are still four weeks behind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your team is infected with &lt;strong&gt;Development Disappointment Disorder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks different in every team. The manager who sets unreasonable deadlines
then demands overtime. The project manager who gets angry at every little thing.
Developers who feel they need to point fingers to shift the blame. The boss who
is never happy no matter what is achieved. The team that feels they have never
had a successful release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unreasonable-expectations:4153c418f6ff9c9d005520a12de36a01&#34;&gt;Unreasonable Expectations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development Disappointment Disorder is caused by unreasonable expectations.&lt;/strong&gt;
Someone thinks, hopes, or wishes they can get 100 units of productivity from a
team and codebase that only can sustain 30-40 units. They want the impossible,
and no amount of cajoling, pressuring, yelling, or passive aggressive comments
will change reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productivity is not completely a people problem. Every team has an upper limit
to what they can produce in a system. The human mind has boundaries. Very real
limits exist given the team&amp;rsquo;s size and existing codebases. While new technical
tools and libraries enable more productive teams, these changes often are
hindered by an existing codebase. The team with a multi-million line C# codebase
is not going to get much value from the productivity gains possible with
Haskell&amp;rsquo;s type system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot rush software development without incurring a drop in quality,
stability, or maintainability. The work is complex and difficult: every expert
in our field agrees with adages like &amp;ldquo;adding developers to a late project makes
it later.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;suggestions:4153c418f6ff9c9d005520a12de36a01&#34;&gt;Suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the technical staff:&lt;/strong&gt; How accurate are your estimates? How consistent
is your throughput? Do you regularly under-estimate your features? Do
developers often say, &amp;ldquo;oh, that&amp;rsquo;s only&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;? Are some types of features &amp;ldquo;always
late&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must learn to be blameless in this situation, and that means striving to
  give as accurate an estimate as you can with what you have. Throwing estimates
  out without much thought only makes things worse. How long did a similar
  feature take last time? If you regularly have inaccurate estimates in a
  certain area of the system, put extra care into those estimates, working to
  provide the best estimate you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the business:&lt;/strong&gt; There is only so many units of productivity that fit
into a given time frame.You need to assess every feature and estimate, and
consider the risk with each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acting disappointed, angry, or passive aggressive will not get you more
  features, it will only demotivate the technical staff. You will get more
  consistency, because they will consistently work slower. You will get more
  hours, but each hour will see a
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.igda.org/?page=crunchsixlessons&#34;&gt;massive drop in valuable work.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting disappointed, angry, or passive aggressive will not get you more features&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unhappy with the work produced, you need to consider why. Were you
  told it would be sooner? Did you promise that to someone? What changed since
  then? If the feature isn&amp;rsquo;t actually needed, why did you pick it? If spending
  twice as much made it not worthwhile, was it really a good choice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would happen if you didn&amp;rsquo;t promise &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; the features would be done?
  Either way, your promise doesn&amp;rsquo;t change when it will be done, it just adds
  risk to your credibility. Often the only thing to be gained by giving out
  estimates and time-lines is risk. Unless the customer is truly blocked on your
  estimate, simply communicate what you are doing, not when you hope it will be
  done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the only thing to be gained by telling customers an estimate is risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the team:&lt;/strong&gt; Celebrate your successes. Abolish the notion of a &amp;ldquo;failed
release&amp;rdquo;. Build up a culture that finds little victories throughout the
release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these tools you can fight Development Disappointment Disorder. You can
start to celebrate what you do accomplish. &lt;strong&gt;A team that is energized and motivated will accomplish more.&lt;/strong&gt; The team that celebrates their work will strive for more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Designing A Compassionate Interview For A High Performing Individual</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/compassionate-interviewing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://deliberate-software.com/compassionate-interviewing/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;After my post &lt;a href=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/on-defeat/&#34;&gt;Interview Humiliation&lt;/a&gt;, a number of
people have asked me how I interview compassionately. I strive to make my interviews as
stress-free and respectful as possible while still rendering a yes/no at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any good interview process needs to start with goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respect the candidate&amp;rsquo;s time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the candidate comfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under-skilled candidates should feel no shame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both passing and failing candidates should want to tell their friends to
apply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should render the same decision if the interview is repeated multiple
times (with different exercises each time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The candidate should know the process in advance and not be able to earn a
pass through short term &amp;ldquo;cramming&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The candidate should feel we are all working collaboratively, instead of us
against them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ideal-candidate:cf61b2cfb55395d828ffadc28b2a9a0d&#34;&gt;The Ideal Candidate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/images/whiteboards2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to hire for high-level skills. Fast learning, strategic thinking, good
design, and emotional intelligence are more important than rote memorization. We
care more about &amp;ldquo;ability to grow&amp;rdquo; than &amp;ldquo;current skills&amp;rdquo;. Our job does not
involve whiteboard coding, puzzle questions, or anything that can be discovered
with a decent IDE, so those are left out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We care a lot about &amp;ldquo;no jerks&amp;rdquo;. We want our workplace to be fun, relaxing, and
supportive. We want candidates who are comfortable being wrong and corrected
regularly, and who can correct others politely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not care about any question that could be easily be answered by Google. If
an internet search can easily answer the question, it is pointless to care if
the human in front of me happens to know it. Given the search revolution of the
last decade, the value of memorized facts falls to almost zero. Facts as a proxy
for actual job skill probably used to be accurate until the internet allowed
every interview question to become public record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scoring:cf61b2cfb55395d828ffadc28b2a9a0d&#34;&gt;Scoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope someone one day invents a perfect productivity score! For now, counting
bugs, features, correct answers, etc, are all proxies that poorly represent
actual productivity. If those actually worked, why don&amp;rsquo;t we use them for raises,
bonuses, and reviews? Because. They. Do. Not. Work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting bugs, features, correct answers, etc, are all proxies that poorly
represent actual productivity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-designed rubric &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; work. A rubric is a way of measuring the
&amp;ldquo;un-measurable&amp;rdquo;. You probably have seen them in year-end reviews. A grid with
categories on one side, and a 1-5 score with a paragraph explanation for each.
We only score what has to be explained with a description from the interviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How was the candidate&amp;rsquo;s communication skills?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They misunderstood me only a few times, and I only had trouble understanding
them once or twice. The watchers all felt like the communication was pretty
good. They were definitely above average: &amp;frac34;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How about design skills?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They were able to clearly design every abstraction. They deeply understood
passing functions as values, see how this takes a function for polymorphism?
We prodded a bit, and they were able to give a couple other ways to achieve
the same behavior. We all agreed it was best the way it was. All said, they
did most of the heavy lifting for this whole project, and it is superbly
designed: 4/4&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-process:cf61b2cfb55395d828ffadc28b2a9a0d&#34;&gt;Our Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &amp;ldquo;level-set&amp;rdquo; our expectations, we had several of our developers at different
levels perform the interview live in front of the team. We made them use various
languages and exercises they had never seen before. This &amp;ldquo;level-setting&amp;rdquo; helped
us to see how known good developers perform when way out of their element and
uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All interviews are assigned to developers randomly, and all are expected to
participate. The candidate should have two developers around at all time, to
prevent bias by any individual. One pairs while the others rotate watching
silently. The watchers are expected to stay quiet, to prevent confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the first interview, the candidate is sent something very much like this
document. We think there is no way someone could &amp;ldquo;fake us out&amp;rdquo; on any criteria.
The things we look for take years of practice to cultivate, so &amp;ldquo;cramming&amp;rdquo; should
not help much (if at all). The one exception to that is if they have never heard
of Test Driven Development, we do recommend they Google it for a few minutes, as
prior knowledge helps smooth the phone screen considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;phone-screen:cf61b2cfb55395d828ffadc28b2a9a0d&#34;&gt;Phone Screen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pair program over the internet using a shared programming environment called
&lt;a href=&#34;c9.io&#34;&gt;Cloud9&lt;/a&gt;. We (currently) have projects set up for Java, JavaScript,
Python, Ruby, and C#. The candidate may choose their desired language. We then
pair program using Test Driven Development to build out a well defined exercise.
The candidate may entirely verbally &amp;ldquo;navigate&amp;rdquo;, while one of our programmers
entirely &amp;ldquo;drives&amp;rdquo; and types out the code. This is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the candidate has never seen any of those languages, Google or asking the
interviewer is totally fair game, and does not count against them. If the
candidate has completely no idea, the interviewer is expected to politely
complete the task while keeping the candidate engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phone screen is under an hour, with 30 minutes for the pair programming.
The remaining time is for questions about our office. We let them drive the
second half of the interview, asking us questions about what our team and
process is like. We attempt to answer clearly and honestly, both good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-person:cf61b2cfb55395d828ffadc28b2a9a0d&#34;&gt;In-Person&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-person interview is from 9:30 to 3:00. We are not thrilled with how much
time it takes and would like to shorten it, but so far have no superior
alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the day, we spend 30 minutes chatting and asking questions back
and forth. Our questions are meant to tell us about the candidate&amp;rsquo;s background
and &amp;ldquo;programming philosophy&amp;rdquo;: books read, favorite languages, interesting
projects they&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, etc. We allow them as many questions as they would
like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day is very much like a &amp;ldquo;typical day at work&amp;rdquo;, but with
programming exercises instead of production code. We pair program on the
exercises, following the same flow from the phone screen. The exercises have no
&amp;ldquo;tricks&amp;rdquo;, they are reasonably straightforward and don&amp;rsquo;t require any prior domain
or CS theory knowledge. Throughout the day, the candidate is free to get food,
drinks, and run to the restroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developer who is pairing has a primary role of making the candidate feel
comfortable and accomplish any effort with a 50/50 split of effort. If the
candidate really is struggling, the developer is expected to keep working with
the candidate, even to the point of doing the hard parts and giving them the
easy parts. A completely unskilled candidate will see their pair doing all the
work with a smile and politely asking for &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; with variable names and such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developer pair is also expected to give the candidate some time to think
if they are lost. The candidate at the end of the interview should feel like
they have a complete understanding of what happened. The exercises are
designed to be &amp;ldquo;too much to finish&amp;rdquo;, and as such finishing the exercises is
not a success criteria as much as working well together and writing
maintainable code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We feel this gives us a highly accurate understanding of a candidate&amp;rsquo;s skill,
while still putting them at ease. Many times we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a terrified candidate
light up fifteen minutes into a pairing session while watching their developer
pair do most of the work. Something about seeing code written &amp;ldquo;activates&amp;rdquo; even
the most nervous candidate. All the thoughts of nerves turn into a concrete
&amp;ldquo;oh, wait, I know what he just did, and I&amp;rsquo;ve got an opinion on that!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:cf61b2cfb55395d828ffadc28b2a9a0d&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We like this process because it is exactly what our job is like. We pair program
for a lot of work, and the interview is meant to give candidates a sample of
that. No one should show up for their first day of work and say, &amp;ldquo;wait, I
actually hate pair programming.&amp;rdquo; By thinking through our goals and an &amp;ldquo;ideal
candidate&amp;rdquo;, we were able to design a process that meets those goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend you take an hour to write out your goals and needs. Then see how
your interview process matches. Are you looking for a &amp;ldquo;human Google&amp;rdquo;? Does your
job involve whiteboard coding? Would telling the candidate the exact process in
advance with all the questions let them game the system? Because every single
interview question I&amp;rsquo;ve seen is up on Google to be found and memorized on easy
to read lists. How much time does your process take? Could it be shortened? Does
it require the candidate to spend a lot of time at home? You might be surprised
at what you find!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily Meditation Improves Technical Leadership</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/daily-meditation-greatly-improved-my-technical-leadership/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, a coworker told me a success story about mindful meditation.
He explained how his wife took a class that required an hour of daily meditation
for a whole month. He reported that she found it uncomfortable, but the effects
were astounding. She claimed to feel more relaxed, more focused, and more
&amp;ldquo;herself&amp;rdquo;. She found new reserves of motivation. She dropped the book she&amp;rsquo;d been
trying to write for years, and started a business. After that business failed,
she started another, this time successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately convinced, I started by listening to guided
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness#Mindfulness_meditation&#34;&gt;mindfulness meditations&lt;/a&gt;
on YouTube and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.headspace.com/science&#34;&gt;phone apps&lt;/a&gt;. After a couple
weeks of that, I started doing breathing exercises on my own while sitting
listening to rain sounds. I made a habit of doing it for about an hour every day
on my lunch break. A few months later, I hated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, after each session I would feel very uncomfortable. I would
be confronted with emotions that made me feel worthless and embarrassed. My mind
was bringing forward all these painful memories and feelings. Over time, I
started to dread the lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-revelation:b62e7cc9b8c7dde38594fd84cce85d41&#34;&gt;The Revelation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, one day, I had a profound sense of understanding. I realized what was
causing these negative emotions. I was in the middle of a major push to guide
our team to adopt a new programming language. While I&amp;rsquo;d led many such
initiatives before, I saw that I&amp;rsquo;d always had the same struggles. My ego and
self-worth were so tied into &amp;ldquo;my&amp;rdquo; campaigns that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to clearly hear
criticism. When people pointed out legitimate concerns or weaknesses, I would
get embarrassed and take it as a personal failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see, from the very beginning, my current &amp;ldquo;campaign&amp;rdquo; had been poorly
executed. After researching the new technology for a long time, I felt like I
saw a place where it could solve some of our needs. Instead of carefully writing
out a proposal, I &amp;ldquo;half-jokingly&amp;rdquo; brought it up whenever I could. When the
listeners didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately react positively, I quickly retracted the idea,
&amp;ldquo;just kidding&amp;rdquo;. Over weeks I dropped not-so-subtle hints, &amp;ldquo;this would be better
with&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;, or, &amp;ldquo;we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have this problem if&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. Instead of convincing
anyone of anything, I just broadcasted to everyone how insecure I felt about the
issue. Everyone could clearly see that I cared, but I was too afraid to put
myself out there and make a serious suggestion. For months nothing changed, and
I felt more and more bitter that &amp;ldquo;my idea&amp;rdquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t being listened to. In reality,
I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even made a serious suggestion yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the people around me started to listen and research the new
language. They agreed it really did solve a need we had. After a while, enough
people got on board that we started using it more. Even then, I held tightly to
&amp;ldquo;my idea&amp;rdquo;, afraid that it would prove to be a failure. When someone ran into
issues, I would get defensive. Even though I tried to keep my emotions in check,
I clearly took any criticism of the language as if it was a personal failing, no
matter how legitimate. I&amp;rsquo;d tightly coupled my ego to my ideas, and I always had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few months of meditating, this idea rocked my world. My negative
emotions came from a realization that my actions were not in line with my
values. I don&amp;rsquo;t want my self-worth to be tied to a simple tool. No tool is worth
it. Every tool fails. I&amp;rsquo;d sold myself short, lowered my self-worth to that of a
tool. This completely blocked my ability to be an effective technical leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear criticism of my ideas without getting defensive, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
think critically. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help work out solutions to the best of my ability,
because that would mean admitting personal failure. Every side comment or
momentary struggle felt like a catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After realizing this, I felt a wave of relief. My emotional struggle leading
this programming language change made sense! And I had an easy way out! I simply
had to distance myself from my ideas, separate my self-worth from my tools. The
more I meditated, the easier it got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;present-day:b62e7cc9b8c7dde38594fd84cce85d41&#34;&gt;Present Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I still sometimes get the old pang of embarrassment or defensiveness, now
I understand where it comes from, and how to move forward. I can let my ideas
go. I can consider ideas critically. I can make changes and adjustments if the
ideas are not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer I decided to write up my learning. I wanted to always be able to
look back and remember these important lessons. My write-up was the seed for the
book &lt;a href=&#34;https://leanpub.com/convincingcoworkers&#34;&gt;Convincing Coworkers&lt;/a&gt;. I explain
the lessons learned from implementing a half dozen major technical changes, and
how I learned to lead without letting my ego cloud my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to become a more effective leader, I highly recommend a practice of
daily meditation. Meditation gives your mind a chance to deeply consider your
actions and values. It allows your subconscious to reflect on what and why you
act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone will struggle from the same issues as me. Every leader has a
different set of challenges and situations. Meditation lets your mind analyze
your unique weaknesses and strengths, coming up with a tailored perspective.
Meditating allows your mind to creatively look for ways to improve itself. While
rarely comfortable, this process can have incredible benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;appendix-i-m-uncomfortable-with-the-connotations-of-meditation:b62e7cc9b8c7dde38594fd84cce85d41&#34;&gt;Appendix: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m uncomfortable with the connotations of meditation&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may feel uncomfortable with meditation because of its current strong
associations with religion. Meditation is not inherently religious. I consider
meditation like an exercise routine for the mind. If you are religious, and
exercise your body as a form of religious expression, exercise is a religious
practice. If you are not religious, and you exercise to improve your health and
well-being, exercise is a secular practice. Meditation is just a form of mental
exercise. Simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation is a tool, and the tool wielder determines its use. Don&amp;rsquo;t let a fear
of the connotations of meditation stop you from experiencing improved
leadership, creativity, and focus!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interview Humiliation</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/on-defeat/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;(All these great ideas, but no one is listening? Check out my
book: &lt;a href=&#34;https://leanpub.com/convincingcoworkers&#34;&gt;Convincing Coworkers&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, I went into an interview, and I was humiliated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-setup:b9c1bea9b4cd584af96fb286bdd6cbd2&#34;&gt;The Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think very highly of myself. This was early on in the Test Driven
Development (TDD) craze, and I was one of the best I knew at it. I knew
interfaces, classes, mocking frameworks, and best practices. I&amp;rsquo;d been taught all
the tricks from some very smart people, and my confidence was high. Not only
that, but I&amp;rsquo;d just finished at work the restoration of an abandoned legacy
codebase to a bug-free, fully tested state completely on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d shipped Java, PHP, Perl, C#, and VB.NET, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been programming more
than a couple years. My first job, they&amp;rsquo;d made me a team lead over some very
senior developers within a year of my hire date. I was learning Clojure and
Common Lisp, and had just shipped an Android game I made entirely alone
(including the 2D physics engine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I was incredible. Yet, due to an overwhelming sense of Imposter
Syndrome, I keenly knew that there were things I didn&amp;rsquo;t know. I&amp;rsquo;m mostly self
taught, so a lot of common CS concepts felt alien. I was waking up before work
and teaching myself algorithms, lisps, and math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Company A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew through the phone screen &amp;ldquo;this is the best phone screen we&amp;rsquo;ve seen!&amp;rdquo; Of
course it is. &amp;ldquo;Your resume is very impressive.&amp;rdquo; Oh, I know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get to the on-site interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-on-site:b9c1bea9b4cd584af96fb286bdd6cbd2&#34;&gt;The On-Site&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been thoughtful enough to ask what to wear, so I wore a suit. I was
asked to present a project I&amp;rsquo;d worked on, and I picked my recently shipped
physics game that was up on Google Play. I walked into the reception area a few
minutes early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;You are 25 minutes late.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?! I explain that I have the email saying 9:30! No matter, &amp;ldquo;hurry, they are
waiting!&amp;rdquo; Maybe I can salvage this. I walk into a conference room with a dozen
people sitting around a table looking bored and pissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Let&#39;s see your presentation.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start to open up my laptop. Meanwhile, they start to joke around to each other:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, wow, Linux, what is this, 2003? I&#39;d hoped I&#39;d never have to see the
grub boot screen again! Can&#39;t you afford a real machine?&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to joke back while multitasking with my laptop. They only have the Mac
projector cable. No adapter. I&amp;rsquo;d thought ahead, and handed one of the developers
a thumb drive with the presentation and code. The interviewers are joking and
laughing to each other at my choice of clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;A suit, classic, where are you interviewing after this, a sales job?&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I roll with it, make some joke about &amp;ldquo;styling&amp;rdquo;. I start presenting about the 2D
physics engine I&amp;rsquo;d written as a learning project for my game. One of the most
interesting parts to me was how I&amp;rsquo;d first written it without any unit testing,
following just Clean Code practices. I then re-wrote it using heavy TDD. The
design turned out very different both times, which I thought was interesting to
see how TDD had influenced the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About five minutes in, I am cut off:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;This presentation is bullshit. You have no evidence, nothing valuable to
show, just spurious subjective opinions. You&#39;ve put up a straw man and now
are trying to knock it down assuming we are idiots. I&#39;ve seen enough.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, it has been barely 15 minutes since I walked in. I remain calm
and professional, and start to address the raised concerns. I play the
meta-game, wondering if perhaps this is a test to see how I&amp;rsquo;ll react when
questioned and embarrassed. Even if this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a test, I was determined to be
at my most professional and finish with my head held high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five developers walk out before I can finish my first sentence. One of the
remaining six interviewers looks embarrassed and asks if I could live code them
a web scraper in any language instead of the presentation. I turn my laptop
around (still no projector) and ask if PHP is acceptable. They are a Python
shop, and PHP is the closest to what they use that I am comfortable using when
this nervous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;PHP? Gross. I suppose if it is all you know...&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;ve got so much adrenaline in me that it takes me a few tries to
log in. I get on a roll after five minutes, and write the scraper. They throw me
a few more requirements, and within a half hour I&amp;rsquo;ve written stories for and
completed them all. At least two of the interviewers seem quite impressed.
Someone looks at their watch, &amp;ldquo;well, that&amp;rsquo;s all the stories we have, I guess
let&amp;rsquo;s break for lunch.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch is a 35 minute walk up a hill in humid 93F weather, and I am wearing a
suit and dress shoes. When we get back from lunch I am hot, tired, and
foot-sore. I distinctly remember my feet blistering inside my sweat-soaked
patent leather shoes. I am called into the conference room again. At this point,
I am genuinely curious if this is some sort of extreme patience/calmness test,
or if I am being filmed for a reality show. No such luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the head of the table is the developer who &amp;ldquo;called me out&amp;rdquo; for my
presentation. Apparently my lunch mates were supposed to only take an hour, we
took almost 90 minutes. He looks at me, rolls his eyes, and asks in the most
sarcastic tone I have ever heard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;So, got any questions for me?&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask a few normal questions, meanwhile he is constantly checking his watch and
rolling his eyes. He answers briefly and rudely. I thank him for his time, and
ask him if there is more. He laughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, we are done here.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am shown to the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sit in the car for a half hour, wondering what just happened. I look over to
the passenger seat piled high with text books I have been studying, books on
language design, compilers, algorithms, physics engines, TDD, and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked none of it. I threw up from stress out the car door into their
parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;aftermath:b9c1bea9b4cd584af96fb286bdd6cbd2&#34;&gt;Aftermath&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out later their recruiter had given me and many other candidates the
wrong time. She was fired shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never found out if I had done something to make everyone so angry. I now
suspect that they were massively turned off by a host of things. Polyglot
programming, practicing TDD, the suit, the not Mac, the late arrival, and a bad
presentation probably all contributed to an immediate disqualification. I
rationally realize they were terrible and treated me terribly, but the
embarrassment is still there. I suspect my presentation was terrible from the
get go: that they were expecting some rock-star and instead got me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of times I have woken up in a cold sweat having dreamt about that
interview. In the large scheme of things, a bad interview is such a small thing,
but fear is fear. I still to this day wonder what I did wrong. Was I arrogant,
cocky, insufferable? Did my ego cause them to treat me that way, or was it all
them? What could I have done differently? I was only in there for a few minutes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few events in my professional life have shaped me as much as that interview. I
have turned it into a forge for my talent, the anvil on which I beat my pride.
When I don&amp;rsquo;t know something, I am more willing to shrug and laugh it off, all
while learning as fast as I can. When I am humiliated professionally, I know
I&amp;rsquo;ve come through worse and thrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;break-the-cycle:b9c1bea9b4cd584af96fb286bdd6cbd2&#34;&gt;Break The Cycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story fills me with an overwhelming desire to never continue the cycle of
abuse. I strive every interview to try to respectfully work with the candidate,
and never humiliate them. I want every person I interview to leave feeling loved
as a human and respected, even if they are completely incapable to perform the
duties of the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ask a question, if they struggle, we work it out together. When I ask for
code, we write it together, even if that means I have to do all the work. I can
make myself their servant, while still assessing their skill with accuracy and
dispassion. Those with the skill will show it, and those without will not feel
humiliated. I let them interview me, and if that means they want me to go up to
the whiteboard and struggle through a merge sort, so be it. In this way, I push
back against the interview culture that normalizes degradation and humiliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interviewing others, take a serious look at your practices. Would a
failed candidate feel humiliated and disrespected? What will they tell their
coworkers and friends at meetups about your company? Will they talk about
feeling respected, and how they hope to get the chance to work with you one day?
Or will they talk of a group of self-righteous jerks who abuse their power to
make others feel small? You can break the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(All these great ideas, but no one is listening? Check out my

      <title>F# Unit Testing With SimpleMock</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/f-number-unit-testing/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://deliberate-software.com/f-number-unit-testing/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;If you are considering using F#, you might be curious how to handle unit test
mocking, especially if you want to use both modules and classes. In a language
like C# or Java, the common method is to a DI container or handmade constructor
injection on a class. These &amp;ldquo;entry points&amp;rdquo; allow for a unit test to replace a
real dependency with a test-only replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I previously posted an example that shows a much simpler way to inject
dependencies called the &lt;a href=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/simplemock-unit-test-mocking/&#34;&gt;SimpleMock pattern&lt;/a&gt;. The SimpleMock pattern can also be
used in F#, even if you are only using modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;simplemock-in-f-modules:43b10499a7e4c1aeb47d57d551a820fe&#34;&gt;SimpleMock in F# Modules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will assume you are mocking inside a module and not a class. Mocking inside
an F# class would look much the same as it does in C#, which we showed in the
SimpleMock post. Here is a sample program that does some work and persists the
results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fsharp&#34;&gt;let addAndSave x y =
  let sum = x + y
  DBModule.saveSum sum
  sum
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply the SimpleMock pattern, we can use argument currying by adding a simple
function wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fsharp&#34;&gt;let addAndSave&#39; saveSum x y = 
  let sum = x + y
  saveSum sum
  sum
let addAndSave = addAndSave&#39; DBModule.saveSum

// Test code
let addAndSave_Test =
  let calledVar = ref 0
  let result = addAndSave&#39; (fun sum -&amp;gt; calledVar := sum) 1 2
  Assert.AreEqual(3, result)
  Assert.AreEqual(3, !calledVar)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started by renaming the &lt;code&gt;addAndSave&lt;/code&gt; function with a trailing &lt;code&gt;&#39;&lt;/code&gt;. We
created a new &lt;code&gt;addAndSave&lt;/code&gt; that calls &lt;code&gt;addAndSave&#39;&lt;/code&gt; with the correct
dependency for the first argument, leaving the rest of the arguments to be
called later. Currying is what allows this ability. The new &lt;code&gt;addAndSave&lt;/code&gt;
function only needs the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; parameters. At test time, we called &lt;code&gt;addAndSave&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, passing in the needed dependency, but using a lambda as the
&amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo;. The injection is as close to the dependency use as possible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bonus-simplemock-fake-helper:43b10499a7e4c1aeb47d57d551a820fe&#34;&gt;Bonus: SimpleMock Fake Helper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earlier replacement for DBModule.saveSum is a bit complex, and it does not
show us how many times the fake was called. We can easily make a helper that
takes parameters and returns them when called, along withe count of times it was
called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fsharp&#34;&gt;type TestFakeResults() =
  member val timesCalled = 0 with get,set
  member val args: obj list = [] with get,set

let makeFake_OneArg () =
  let results = new TestFakeResults()
  let fake = (fun p1 -&amp;gt;
                  results.args &amp;lt;- p1 :: results.args
                  results.timesCalled &amp;lt;- results.timesCalled + 1
                  ())
  (fake, results)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above code might be hard to comprehend at first! We have made a generic
helper that can create any single argument fake we need. We return a tuple,
containing the fake lambda and an instance of &lt;code&gt;TestFakeResults&lt;/code&gt;. The fake
lambda will populate the &lt;code&gt;TestFakeResults&lt;/code&gt;, which we can access in the test
via the second arg of the tuple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now re-write the previous test using &lt;code&gt;makeFake_OneArg&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fsharp&#34;&gt;// Test code
let addAndSave_Test =
  let (fakeSave, fakeSaveCalling) = makeFake_OneArg()
  let result = addAndSave&#39; fakeSave 1 2
  Assert.AreEqual(3, result)
  Assert.AreEqual(3, fakeSaveCalling.args.[0])
  Assert.AreEqual(1, fakeSaveCalling.timesCalled)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TestFakeResults can return information about the way it was called,
including the list of all arguments. If we felt we needed the extra
expressiveness, we could also use a mocking library like RhinoMocks or Moq. The
TestFakeResults and its constructor are not essential to the pattern. The most
important part is learning to unit test in F# with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;double-bonus-when-to-use-a-class-instead-of-a-record:43b10499a7e4c1aeb47d57d551a820fe&#34;&gt;Double Bonus: When to Use a Class Instead of a Record&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first wrote this post, I used a record instead of a class for the &lt;code&gt;TestFakeResults&lt;/code&gt; type. If you have been bitten by the functional programming bug,
you might have wondered at my usage of a mutable class. Here are two alternates
of &lt;code&gt;makeFake_OneArg&lt;/code&gt; which use records. You can probably see why I switched to a class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fsharp&#34;&gt;type TestFakeResults = {timesCalled:int, args obj list}

// Using Record Alternate 1
let makeFake_OneArg_RecordAlternate1 () = 
  let t = ref 0
  let a : obj list ref = ref []
  let fake = (fun p1 -&amp;gt;
                  a := p1 :: !a
                  t := !t + 1
                  ())
  (fake, (fun () -&amp;gt;
                {TestFakeRecord.timesCalled = !t;
                 args = !a}))

// Using Record Alternate 2
let makeFake_OneArg_RecordAlternate2 () = 
  let result = ref {TestFakeRecord.timesCalled = 0; args = []}
  let fake = (fun p1 -&amp;gt;
              result := {timesCalled = (!result).timesCalled + 1;
                         args = p1 :: (!result).args}
              ())
  (fake, (fun () -&amp;gt; !result))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to use a record is to delay its construction via a lambda which
must be executed by the test code. Both are complex: what we need is a mutable
data structure which we can access via a reference. A record is not that. We can
approximate it using tricks, but ultimately I find both alternatives to be too
complex to justify their use. Sometimes a mutable data structure is the best
choice to solve your problem efficiently. The power of F# is that it gives us
the ability to choose the best tool for the job: records for immutability,
classes for mutability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SimpleMock: Language Agnostic Unit Test Mocking</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/simplemock-unit-test-mocking/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;SimpleMock is a pattern for reducing TDD damage. You can use the pattern to
organize your testing code without mocking or complicated dependency injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SimpleMock works in any language with closures that can be passed around by
reference, so off the top of my head: C#, Java, F#, Scala, PHP, C++, Ruby, and
Python. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can think of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example:442bb35a3947650665613cec7b90f820&#34;&gt;Example:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a brief (if a bit silly) example of the final pattern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;public class LineCounter {
    internal Func&amp;lt;string, IEnumerable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&amp;gt; _readLines = File.ReadLines;

    public string CountLines(string filename) {
        return _readLines(filename).Count();
    }
}

/// Test Code
[TestCase]
public void TestLineCounter () {
    var sut = new LineCounter();
    // &amp;quot;SimpleMock&amp;quot; of File.ReadLines
    sut._readLines = (string x) =&amp;gt; new List&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;{&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;};

    var result = sut.CountLines(&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;);

    Assert.AreEqual(2, result);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;benefits:442bb35a3947650665613cec7b90f820&#34;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced boilerplate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saves interfaces for real polymorphism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplifies test code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces testing concerns in production code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removes need for fragile IoC containers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourages better abstraction design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can convert one class at a time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SimpleMock pattern promotes a better design of your abstractions and simpler
tests. The pattern also reduces boilerplate and the pollution of your production
code with testing concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the normal pattern of unit test mocking using
interfaces, dependency injection, and mock libraries, scroll down to &amp;ldquo;The
Non-SimpleMock Way&amp;rdquo; at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;simplemock-pattern:442bb35a3947650665613cec7b90f820&#34;&gt;SimpleMock Pattern&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SimpleMock pattern is aptly named.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace Test-Only Interfaces With Functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define Dependencies Inline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write Better Abstractions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-one-replace-test-only-interfaces-with-functions:442bb35a3947650665613cec7b90f820&#34;&gt;Step One: Replace Test-Only Interfaces With Functions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My examples are in C# because that is what I got paid to write today - it is
freshest in memory. C# has an incredible ability to create and pass around
lambdas and function references. Here is an example of using functions instead
of interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;public class CurrentTime : ICurrentTime {
    public DateTime GetCurrentTime() {
        return DateTime.Now();
    }
}
public class Translator {
    private Func&amp;lt;DateTime&amp;gt; _getCurrentTime;

    public Translator() : this(new CurrentTime().GetCurrentTime) {}

    public Translator(Func&amp;lt;DateTime&amp;gt; getCurrentTime) {
        this._getCurrentTime = getCurrentTime;
    }

    public string Translate(string input) {
        return string.Format(&amp;quot;{0}: {1}&amp;quot;, _getCurrentTime().ToString(), input);
    }
}

/// Test Code
[TestCase]
public void TestCurrentTimeTranslator () {
    var now = DateTime.Now;

    var sut = new Translator(() =&amp;gt; now);

    var result = sut.Translate(&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;);

    Assert.AreEqual(now.ToString() + &amp;quot;: test&amp;quot;, result);
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test code is quite simple! No longer do we need the dependency on third
party mocking libraries, or the relatively complicated setup logic. Instead we
can simply inject the lambda at runtime, replacing that pointer. We didn&amp;rsquo;t need
the whole interface, really we just needed the simple signature of the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2-define-dependencies-inline:442bb35a3947650665613cec7b90f820&#34;&gt;Step 2: Define Dependencies Inline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can take it even a step further. Why use constructor injection at all? Since
all we really want is a single mutable dispatch table row, why not just make it
that way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;public class Translator {
    internal Func&amp;lt;DateTime&amp;gt; _getCurrentTime = new CurrentTime().GetCurrentTime;

    public string Translate(string input) {
        return string.Format(&amp;quot;{0}: {1}&amp;quot;, _getCurrentTime().ToString(), input);
    }
}

/// Test Code
[TestCase]
public void TestCurrentTimeTranslator () {
    var now = DateTime.Now;
    var sut = new Translator();
    sut._getCurrentTime = () =&amp;gt; now;

    var result = sut.Translate(&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;);

    Assert.AreEqual(now.ToString() + &amp;quot;: test&amp;quot;, result);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve cleaned up our nasty multi-line indirection into a single dispatch line.
&amp;ldquo;Go to definition&amp;rdquo; now takes me to the actual line with the actual called
function. We&amp;rsquo;ve replaced a dependency on a class based interface with a function
signature. The function signature &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the interface!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably noticed we have lost something with this final version. We have
lost the ability to inject polymorphic behavior through the constructor. If you
need it, simply go back to injecting the interface in the constructor or by
passing it into the function itself. In practice, I have found this is needed
very rarely, making the SimpleMock pattern a better tool to reach for first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-3-write-better-abstractions:442bb35a3947650665613cec7b90f820&#34;&gt;Step 3: Write Better Abstractions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, SimpleMock actually promotes better designs. For example, a coworker was
writing some tests today and ran into a complicated situation. Take the
following sanitized code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;public class WorkDoer {
    internal Action&amp;lt;Thing&amp;gt; ignoreElements = new ThingIgnorer().IgnoreElements;
    internal Action&amp;lt;Thing&amp;gt; removeIgnoredElements = new ThingRemover().RemoveElements;

    public void IgnoreAndRemoveThings(Thing t1, Thing t2) {
        ignoreElements(t1);
        ignoreElements(t2);
        removeIgnoredElements(t1);
        removeIgnoredElements(t2);
    }
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you check that each section was called? Our naive solution was a
complicated lambda with a &amp;ldquo;timesCalled&amp;rdquo; counter and an if statement to assert
against each argument, but it turns nasty quickly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;/// Nasty test code
[TestCase]
public void TestWorkDoer () {
    var sut = new WorkDoer();

    var ignoredCalledTimes = 0;
    sut.ignoreElements = (t) =&amp;gt; {
        ignoredCalledTimes++;
        if (ignoredCalledTimes == 1) {
            Assert.AreEqual(t1, t);
        } else {
            Assert.AreEqual(t2, t);
        }
    };
    var removedCalledTimes = 0;
    sut.removeIgnoredElements = (t) =&amp;gt; {
        removedCalledTimes++;
        if (removedCalledTimes == 1) {
            Assert.AreEqual(t1, t);
        } else {
            Assert.AreEqual(t2, t);
        }
    };

    var t1 = new Thing();
    var t2 = new Thing();

    var result = sut.IgnoreAndRemoveThings(t1, t2);
    Assert.AreEqual(2, removedCalledTimes);
    Assert.AreEqual(2, ignoredCalledTimes);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuck! The test is an absolute catastrophe. I see a mess of mixed concerns.
Conditionals?! In a test?! Unconscionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In situations like this, we have two easy options. Option one is to just use
a third party mocking library, replacing the functions from inside the test
code. This gives us access to all the sophisticated mocking tools available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My preferred option is seeking to decomplect the production code by using better
abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found that strong reliance of mocking libraries enables worse designs.
Consider the code, what makes it so hard to test? Not knowing which element is
called when, doing the same work on two parameters, and reference mutation all
make this a poor abstraction. Why not simplify?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;public class WorkDoer {
    internal Func&amp;lt;Thing, Thing&amp;gt; ignoreElements = new ThingIgnorer().IgnoreElements;
    internal Func&amp;lt;Thing, Thing&amp;gt; removeIgnoredElements = new ThingRemover().RemoveElements;

    public List&amp;lt;Thing&amp;gt; IgnoreAndRemoveThings(List&amp;lt;Thing&amp;gt; ts) {
        return ts.Select(t =&amp;gt; removeIgnoredElements(ignoreElements(t)));
    }
}

/// Simpler test
[TestCase]
public void TestWorkDoer () {
    var sut = new WorkDoer();
    var expected = new Thing();
    var ts = new List&amp;lt;Thing&amp;gt;{new Thing()};

    sut.ignoreElements = (t) =&amp;gt; new Thing();

    sut.removeIgnoredElements = (t) =&amp;gt; {
        Assert.AreEqual(t, sut.ignoreElements(t));
        return expected;
    };

    var result = sut.IgnoreAndRemoveThings(ts);

    Assert.AreEqual(expected, result.First())
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much better! Yes, we had to change a few signatures. We get the same work done,
but now the code is actually a lot more useful. Our test code is comparable with
anything you&amp;rsquo;d find using a mocking library. I am absolutely okay with using a
mocking library when needed, but I always carefully consider my abstractions and
design first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If mocking libraries and IoC containers are the chainsaws of the testing world,
then SimpleMock is the garden shears. Sometimes the chainsaw is the only tool
for the job, and that is fine. But for most work around the yard, you can leave
the chainsaw in the shed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:442bb35a3947650665613cec7b90f820&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve shown how you can really simplify your code with SimpleMock. The dispatch
row is clear and easy to read. We have removed some third party mocking
dependencies. You can remove a lot of the boilerplate &amp;ldquo;for making it more
testable&amp;rdquo; from your code. The test code is greatly simplified, and injection a
breeze. The result: much simpler code, just as easy to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Shuwei Chen for helping me put this together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-non-simplemock-way:442bb35a3947650665613cec7b90f820&#34;&gt;The Non-SimpleMock Way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with unit test mocking with interfaces, this part is
probably boring. Feel free to skip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional way of performing C# unit test mocking involves dependency
injection and interface mocking using a mocking library. For dependency
injection, it is common to use a tool like Ninject or hand-rolled constructor
injection. For mocking, a library like Moq or Rhino Mocks is standard. Here is
an example of a class and its testing code without any business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;public interface ICurrentTime {
    DateTime GetCurrentTime();
}

public class CurrentTime : ICurrentTime {
    public DateTime GetCurrentTime() {
        return DateTime.Now();
    }
}

public class Translator {
    private readonly ICurrentTime ct;

    public Translator() : this(new CurrentTime()) {}

    public Translator(ICurrentTime currentTime) {
        this.ct = currentTime;
    }

    public string Translate(string input) {
        return string.Format(&amp;quot;{0}: {1}&amp;quot;, ct.GetCurrentTime().ToString(), input);
    }
}

/// Test Code with Moq
[TestCase]
public void TestCurrentTimeTranslator () {
    var rightNow = DateTime.Now;
    var mock = new Mock&amp;lt;ICurrentTime&amp;gt;();

    mock.Setup(a=&amp;gt;a.GetCurrentTime()).Returns(rightNow);

    var sut = new Translator(mock.Object);

    var result = sut.Translate(&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;);

    Assert.AreEqual(rightNow.ToString() + &amp;quot;: test&amp;quot;, result);
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve done much C# unit testing, this should look familiar. We want to
inject some code that is potentially long-running or dynamic. We put that code
into a class, add an interface, then inject that interface into the class we
want to test. To test it, we mock the interface, creating a different concrete
class at test runtime which implements that interface. We can setup that mock to
respond with anything, which we use for assertions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-wrong-with-the-non-simplemock-way:442bb35a3947650665613cec7b90f820&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Wrong with the Non-SimpleMock Way?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem is we have created a whole interface just for testing.
Interfaces are for polymorphism, but we don&amp;rsquo;t really need polymorphism for this
class. We simply want to mock it. The constructor injection is also test code
polluting our business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have done is create a very small and primitive dispatch table. The
table has one row: something that has a function with the signature of &lt;code&gt;() -&amp;gt; DateTime&lt;/code&gt; or, as it is known in C#: &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;DateTime&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  We will need to make
this primitive dispatch table for every single mock in every single class we
wish to test. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of boilerplate!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programming Language Safety Score Mark 2</title>
      <link>http://deliberate-software.com/safety-rank-part-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://deliberate-software.com/safety-rank-part-2/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.14/angular.min.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/javascripts/sliders2.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make a model that predicts bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I previously wrote a table for scoring language safety:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/programming-language-safety-algorithm&#34;&gt;Programming Language Safety Score&lt;/a&gt;,
but it was extremely time consuming to score new languages or make modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;simplify-simplify:97a282fd1f3c6848927d72787ebd3b6e&#34;&gt;Simplify, Simplify&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being told I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting&#34;&gt;overfitting&lt;/a&gt;
the data, I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to clean up by simply checking if each category is
enforced, possible, or impossible. I score each as either 1 (language enforced),
0 (possible, but you have to remember to do it), or -1 (impossible). When the
magnitudes of the new model are compared with the previous model, they come out
very similar. The shape of the curve pretty much stays the same, which I was
told indicates that the character count weighting was a variable that didn&amp;rsquo;t
matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/images/rplot.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code I used to generate the plot and normalize the scores can be found here:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/steveshogren/datasciencecoursera/blob/817dec79e36b6e9a6c5a8fd5700aff7cc394b9d4/scoreplot.R&#34;&gt;scorePlot.R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;safety-definitions:97a282fd1f3c6848927d72787ebd3b6e&#34;&gt;Safety Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A definition of the safety checks is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div ng-app=&#34;TableApp2&#34;&gt;
&lt;div ng-controller=&#34;TableCtrl&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;langtable&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Check&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr ng-repeat=&#34;check in langChecks&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ check.name }} &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; {{ check.desc }}  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The new scores are shown here, with a lot more languages added in:

&lt;p class=&#34;lead&#34;&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;overflow-x:scroll&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;langtable&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Safety Check&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
&lt;select ng-options=&#34;getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages&#34; ng-model=&#34;languages[0]&#34;&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
&lt;select ng-options=&#34;getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages&#34; ng-model=&#34;languages[1]&#34;&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
&lt;select ng-options=&#34;getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages&#34; ng-model=&#34;languages[2]&#34;&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
&lt;select ng-options=&#34;getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages&#34; ng-model=&#34;languages[3]&#34;&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr ng-repeat=&#34;check in langChecks&#34; score-row name=&#34;check.name&#34; row-key=&#34;check.key&#34;&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;totals&#34;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Totals&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td ng-repeat=&#34;lang in langTotals track by $index&#34;&gt;
{{ lang }}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;totals&#34;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Magnitude&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td ng-repeat=&#34;lang in langTotals track by $index&#34;&gt;
{{ percentageTotals(lang) }}%
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current Languages:
&lt;span ng-repeat=&#34;lang in allLanguages&#34;&gt;
{{ getName(lang) }}: {{ allLangTotals[$index] }},
&lt;/select&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-s-the-point:97a282fd1f3c6848927d72787ebd3b6e&#34;&gt;So, What&amp;rsquo;s the Point?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see how this model corresponds with data in the real world, I used the GitHub
API to query for the number of bugs created in repositories with more than 15
forks created in a span from 2011 to 2015. Commits were counted by summing the
commit counts of all contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to rely on the count of commits as a standard for a unit of work. My
assumption was that across fifty different projects, the commit sizes would
average out. Once the unit of work was decided on, I wanted to find the ratio of
bugs per commit for each language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I collected the ratio of bugs logged per commit for each repository, and after
grouping by primary language, removed the top and bottom 25% using the
bug/commit ratio, which is a common practice in statistics to help find a more
accurate average. I summed the bugs and commits of those remaining repositories
grouped by language, finding a total average bug/commit ratio for each language
grouping. Here is that data, sorted by safety score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&#34;langtable&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Bugs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Commits&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Repositories&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Bug/Commits&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;tr ng-repeat=&#34;lang in languageRatios&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ lang.name }} &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ lang.bugs }} &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ lang.commits }} &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ lang.repos }} &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ getBugsRatio(lang) }} &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the languages sorted by safety score with bug/commit ratios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/images/errorChart.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/images/bugsAverage.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the magnitude of the safety scores and the bug/commit ratios. After
inverting the safety scores, I overlaid them both onto a single graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://deliberate-software.com/images/bothMags.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately it is obvious that Ruby, Python, PHP, and Clojure all seem to strongly
buck the trend, but otherwise the languages follow a pretty consistent slope
down in bugs. Taking the correlation gives a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient&#34;&gt;correlation coefficient&lt;/a&gt;
of .55&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-unit-tests:97a282fd1f3c6848927d72787ebd3b6e&#34;&gt;What About Unit Tests?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking that Ruby, Clojure, PHP, and Python might not correlate well due to some
other factor, I collected data on how many tests each repository had. I counted
the number of files containing &amp;ldquo;test&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;spec&amp;rdquo;, which gave the following,
sorted by tests per commit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&#34;langtable&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Tests&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Commits&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Repositories&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Tests/Commits&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr ng-repeat=&#34;lang in sorter(languageRatios)&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ lang.name }} &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ lang.test }} &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ lang.commits }} &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ lang.repos }} &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ getTestsRatio(lang) }} &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHP, Python, and Ruby all have a higher then average number of tests, but
Clojure does not. Additionally, Go, Scala, and Java all also have a higher than
average number of tests, yet they score relatively average in bugs/commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:97a282fd1f3c6848927d72787ebd3b6e&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the current safety model I have proposed seems to account for a
moderate reduction in bugs per commit across the sampled languages, but is not
the only factor. It currently is unable to account for a significantly lower
than expected bug count in Ruby and Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mess up something about a language here, or am I missing a safety check? I&amp;rsquo;ll happily take pull
requests for new languages:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/steveshogren/blog-source/blob/master/source/javascripts/sliders2.js&#34;&gt;blog source&lt;/a&gt;. Just
pick an existing language, edit the name and values, and &amp;ldquo;copy to clipboard&amp;rdquo; to
build your own language data structure. Send it to me in a PR and I&amp;rsquo;ll include
it along with a thanks on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div ng-show=&#34;showRealName&#34;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Select Language:
&lt;select ng-options=&#34;lang.name for lang in allLanguages&#34; ng-model=&#34;selectedLang&#34;&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;button ng-click=&#34;copyToClipboard(selectedLang)&#34;&gt;Copy Changes to Clipboard&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;input ng-model=&#34;selectedLang.name&#34;&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;langtable&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Check&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Option&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr ng-repeat=&#34;check in langChecks&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;background-color:{{scoreClass(score(selectedLang[check.key]))}} &#34;&gt;
{{ check.name }}: {{score(selectedLang[check.key]) }}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;select ng-options=&#34;enforcedNice(e) for e in enforcedTypes&#34; ng-model=&#34;selectedLang[check.key].enforced&#34;&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
