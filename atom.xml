Macros are the most powerful way to manipulate the syntax of your language. Macros make it possible to completely modify your language to match your domain. To explain them, think for a minute about functions using the simple “substitution model” used to teach functions to beginner programmers. The substitution model has the reader replace a function call with the body of the called function.

<p>
Ignoring scoping, the function/call system allows for immense power in programing languages. The function lets you &#8220;expand&#8221; a simple call into a much larger block of code. The expanded code can be vastly large. In our example above, the (doCalc) function is small, but it reality it could be doing hundreds of lines of code, which also would have to be substituted in place. The difference is real functions do not work this way. Real functions have their values evaluated before getting passed in as parameters.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">Macros are similar to the substitution model, with one expressed difference: by default, macros operate on the text of the code itself, not the values. Think of how expansion works in the simple if statement.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Does the huge calc function execute each time? Not at all, you are guaranteed that only one will happen at any given run through that block of code.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s say you wanted to make a generic function that would abstract away that call, and let you return the values, maybe something like this:</p>

<p>
But wait, now BOTH functions get called, you are doing exactly twice as many huge calcs as needed. Now, those familiar with javascript probably are already itching with the solution, &#8220;JUST WRAP THEM IN ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS!!!&#8221;. I hear you, sure that works in this super simple example, but macros let you do this without that extra wordiness.  Macros defer evaluating parameters. Think of a macro as a function, but the biggest difference is parameters DON&#8217;T get called till you choose to call them.

<p dir="ltr">Now, in this simple ruby example, I had to use strings and eval to approximate what happens with macros in other languages. Since this is unwieldy, let’s switch to clojure, where it is more natural.</p>
I said that macros defer evaluation, they do that, but they also do much more. Lets look at a clojure list.

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="err">‘</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span> <span class="nv">c</span> <span class="nv">d</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;=&gt; (a b c d)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p dir="ltr">This is a list of four symbols. Symbols are basically like an enum or a keyword that only equals itself. So it is possible to say:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">= </span><span class="err">‘</span><span class="nv">a</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="nv">a</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;=&gt; true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p dir="ltr">but that’s pretty much it. If I tried to evaluate a symbol, it would complain that the symbol has no definition, since it is trying to treat it like a variable lookup.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; nothing gets evaluated inside the list at all..</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">‘</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span> <span class="nv">c</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p dir="ltr">Now you are left with a list of symbols, unevaluated. The defmacro form, for each parameter, gives you such a list of unevaluated symbols.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The ` is called syntax quote, it disables evaluation much like quote does (it just also namespaces everything inside for your convenience). The ~ is called an unquote, and it turns evaluation back on. In any given space, if you have a function called (id), and you called it like (`~id), it would mean the same as just calling (id), because you turned off evaluation, then turned it back on. Above, the bigCalc parameters are filled with the actual values passed in, the lists unevaluated of ‘(+ 1 1) and ‘(otherBigCalc). I like to think of the return from a macro as a “template” to replace the original call with. Take the call (ifWorkday (+ 1 1) (otherBigCalc)). When calling the macro, the last thing returned from the macro is expected to be a list of clojure code to replace the original call at compile time. So, at compile time, (ifWorkday (+ 1 1) (otherBigCalc)) is replaced with (if (workday (today)) (+ 1 1) (otherBigCalc)) which is the return from the macro.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But that is a stupid example. Making your own if statements is the most basic uses of macros. But it demonstrates the point: macros generate code. This is profound, but hard to grasp for the first time. Macros expand code before compilation time, and therefore can be used to generate lots of code automatically.</p>

<p>
For extra credit, let’s take a bigger example in the same vein as our custom ifWorkday. I am making a game, and in it, I want an easy abstraction that gives me back one of several options with a custom percent chance. Ideally, something like
</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>
where the number corresponds to the percent chance that the next item will be executed and returned. In this example, (doFirst) will only happen 25% of the time and (doSecond) 75% of the time. This demonstrates a more interesting use of macros, the ability to generate other functions (or even other macros). Here is the code:

<p dir="ltr">I hope the profundity of this hits you like a ton of bricks. With under 10 lines of macro code (and calling it) we auto-generated 100 macros! This 10 lines of code gets expanded to 100 more lines! Sure, this is a simple, almost silly example, but imagine what you could do with this sort of power. In a more complex example, you could be auto-generating vast amounts of code this way, code that you don’t have to write every time by hand. Don&#8217;t let the x__2506__auto__ parameter names scare you, I will explain that in a bit.</p>
<p>
Those generated macros should not be too hard to understand after the previous ifWorkday macro, and they can be called just like we expect. Let&#8217;s deconstruct (make-percents).

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p dir="ltr">The ~@ is like unquote from above, the only difference is instead of just unquoting a list to be evaluated, it extracts the values from the list and sticks them in place. I like to think of it as just removing the outer parens in the unquoted list.</p>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p dir="ltr">The (list) function is just how we make a list of elements.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;=&gt; (a b c)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>
The (map) function has two arguments: the first, a function; the second, a list of elements to “map” over.
</p>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p dir="ltr">As you can see here, the ~@() tells us to unquote the whole form, re-enabling the evaluation, and therefore running the map call. The map then calls the anonymous function 100 times, with the num being the numbers 0..99. Inside the anon function we have a let binding:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">macro-name</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">symbol </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="s">&quot;if&quot;</span> <span class="nv">num</span><span class="p">))]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p dir="ltr">This line is more simple, it makes a let that binds to the value macro-name a symbol that looks like ‘if1, ‘if2, .. depending on which iteration of the loop you are on.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="o">`</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defmacro </span><span class="o">~</span><span class="nv">macro-name</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">x#</span> <span class="nv">y#</span><span class="p">]</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p dir="ltr">Here is the actual returned “template” of the macro. The # at the end of the parameter name ensures that it is unique, which is really really useful when you consider that the code returned from a macro replaces the call in place. To make sure you don’t accidentally double bind the same name, clojure will give you a warning like “cannot let unqualified name” if you try to let a value without including the # at the end inside a template, another really handy feature. What gets generated by x# looks something like x__2506__auto__ which is guaranteed to be unique. The reason you need this is in case there was another value bound to x inside your code, it could cause a conflict, and in certain circumstances, really break your code, so this prevents such conflicts. You should only need these when creating parameters or let bindings inside the template. All the values &#8220;outside&#8221; the template do not need to have the # appended to their names, since they will not actually be a part of the returned template.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The only odd thing here is the double ~~num. Notice how many quote levels deep we are. It is possible to unquote to “step” back up a level in the template. By the time we get to the ~~num, the original function parameter of num was two “levels” higher, so to access it, we have to “step up” two levels. Let me highlight it in colors, to make it easier to see.</p>

<img src="http://steveshogren.github.io/images/macro.jpg" title="" >

<p dir="ltr">See how by unquoting ~macro-name one level in line 3, and unquoting ~~num two levels on line 4, we bring them both back “up” to the “red” level where they were defined? Similarly, by unquoting ~x# and ~y# one level on line 4, we bring them back “up” to their “blue” definition level? This is an incredibly powerful tool that allows immense expansion of code in a tiny amount of space. If you think of the returned code form as a “template”, this quoting and unquoting lets you step in and out of evaluation with ease.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the end, when the (make-percents) macro is called, it produces 100 macros that are callable just like any other macro. To tell the whole story, I wrote this into my game, then decided I wanted a more sophisticated macro that could take any number of percentages, but this remained a good way to explain this specific pattern of looped macro generation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hopefully, this article caused you to see how incredibly powerful macros can be, allowing effectively infinite auto-generation of code. The field of macros is still very under-explored, as most languages do not allow them at all, they remain a largely undiscovered, and yet incredibly powerful tool.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For further reading, I highly recommend Let Over Lambda, the first 6 chapters of which are free <a href="http://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/toc">here</a>. Let Over Lambda is written with examples in Common Lisp, but the macro parts are very similar in Clojure, so is a valuable read.</p>

Which is incredibly cool. At the time, I could see using that all the time for helpful benefits. In the last few days though, I realized a more obvious function has been far more helpful to my daily development: deftrace. Deftrace just replaces a defn, and does the same, but it also prints out the ins and outs of the function.

<br />
At this point in the demo, the room was leaping out of their chairs laughing in sheer delight at how awesome this is. It is ultimately such a simple idea, and yet it&#8217;s execution is brilliant and inconceivably handy.
<br />
<br />
At first, I thought, &#8220;well that is an incredibly cool party trick, but a party trick nonetheless&#8221;. A few days of regular clojure development later, I realized the profundity of this library.
<br />
<br />
I have had on my list of &#8220;pain points&#8221; an item to learn how to debug clojure code. Once in a while, I have felt the need to find out exactly what was going on at a certain point, and had to awkwardly put in (do (pprint x) x) statements everywhere. Clearly though, that is lame.
<br />
<br />
Here is the grand reveal. <strong>Concepts and tools that other languages have sometimes look very different in clojure.</strong> &#8220;Well, duh&#8221;, you say. I am not talking about syntax! I am talking about the <em>tools.</em>
<br />
<br />
I wanted a debugger (and, yes, I know at least traditional one exists for clojure), and so that is what I would have looked for: the traditional &#8220;put in a breakpoint, run the code, pause at that place, inspect values, etc&#8221;. When I first saw tools.trace, the image of a &#8220;debugger replacement&#8221; did not immediately enter my head. But, tools.trace basically gives me almost all the benefit of a traditional debugger at effectively no hassle or cost. Just now I was developing some code, and got stuck on a spot where something unexpected happened, and with only a second&#8217;s hassle, replaced a few defns with deftrace. I re-ran my code in the repl, and now got a printout of exactly what the in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s were, and all of a sudden it clicked. &#8220;I just found my new debugger&#8221;, and, &#8220;wow, this debugger is way less hassle&#8221;.
<br />
<br />
No, of course this doesn&#8217;t do everything a full debugger does, but at least for the foreseeable future, it probably will do enough most of the time. The first time I need a real full debugger, I will go looking for it, but for now, I suspect this gets me my 80% benefit for way less than 20% hassle.
<br />
<br />
The discovery of such tools is what is making learning clojure such a profoundly rewarding journey for me. I am being taught to think about the &#8220;default ide&#8221; tools in such a different light. Watching as community members distill out these sort of High-Value concentrate tools using Clojure&#8217;s meta-programming is simply the most mind altering thing I have experienced in programming.

    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/refactoring-not-free/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/refactoring-not-free</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Sometimes, it’s far more efficient to leave certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debts</a> unpaid.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m not saying we should leave messes, instead I am saying that cleaning and fixing technical debt is so important we must prioritize the most important changes first, by highest value to the team. You don&#8217;t just do whatever feature is next alphabetically do you? Nope, so neither should you do that with refactorings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not all technical debts are created equal: they consist of varying amounts of interest as well as principal. We still don’t have a way to accurately count the cost of technical debt. Fortunately, a little effort goes a long way toward estimating the its “payoff price”. Much like paying off a real debt, paying the highest-interest debts first makes the most sense.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ll give you a real life example of some technical debt repayments. Last month at my work, we all agreed that all our namespaces, project names, and assembly names were woefully out of date. The naming confusion hadn&#8217;t cost us a lot of time, but, like an annoying paper cut, we felt the pain whenever we looked at it. The system had outgrown the single small product it once was, and the names had not grown with it. A few project names did not even match up with their folders, causing extra disorientation every time anyone read them. We all voted to make updating all that cruft our “dev chore” of the week. Unfortunately, we did not weigh the relative cost versus the value of that cleanup to the team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Three weeks later, we were still neck-deep in cleanup. The renaming process caused many subtle bugs because of a variety of unconsidered issues. Our work ground to a halt as we put all hands on deck to finish the task and fix all the bugs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We hadn’t considered the terms on that technical debt. The principal was high: paying it cost weeks of nonstop effort. What about the interest? At best, it was tiny, fractions of a percent of the time it took to pay it off. How long will it take us to make that time back? Five years? Ten?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now consider another common refactoring: renaming a private function. What does it cost to fix a badly named local function? Practically nothing, just a few keystrokes. What does it cost to leave it undone? You have to look at that bad function definition each time you work in that file. Leaving the technical debt would cost more than paying it down. Why wouldn’t you immediately pay down such a debt?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Clearly, this is not an exact science, but our refactorings will take on a very critical dimension when we add interest to the technical debt metaphor. I now evaluate any refactoring effort that would take longer than a few minutes in this mindset, thinking critically about what I do and why. I keep my big technical debt chores in a list prioritized by interest (regardless of the principal), so there is never any doubt what my next task should be.</p>

    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/how-to-escape-from-programming_language</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[As time goes on, developers will be all the harder pressed to keep up with the skyrocketing number of languages and frameworks. The number of javascript libraries alone is increasing at a furious pace: Angular, Backbone, Node, Ember, Knockout, Knockback, Meteor, etc, etc, etc. Who has a chance at keeping up? While having so many options is also beneficial, it makes it more and more challenging for a single developer to stay relevant.
<br />
<br />
You are a good programmer. No, you are a great programmer. But, you are stuck in one development stack. You want to diversify your knowledge, experience, and skill set, but your resume reads like a one-act play. Chances are, you didn&#8217;t deliberately choose to work in this stack. At the start of your career, the first job you landed was probably the best you could find. Several years have gone by, and you are beginning to realize that the development world is moving on.
<br />
<br />
Maybe you have already tried, having gone to a few interviews. Nevertheless, you’re still as stuck as when you started, because many of the cool shops are still figuring out how to do good hiring in this new, fast-changing paradigm. They want developers who already have experience in their stack, but they haven&#8217;t realized that filtering for previous experience is only one heuristic for finding good talent. So, what are your options?
<br />
<br />
Here is how to escape from your language. Like all the best advice, it is simple, yet profound. It consists of the following three steps:
<br />
<br />
1. Pick a new stack.<br />
 2. Learn it.<br />
 3. Build a network.
<br />
<br />
Picking a stack is not an easy thing to do, but I have good news for you: once you master these steps, you won&#8217;t ever be stuck again. No matter which one you pick, when the time comes, you will be able to quickly move way ahead of the pack. Don’t worry about trying to pick the one that will last your whole career, since, (and this may come as a shock to you) it probably won&#8217;t last you a decade! That&#8217;s why we should love software development, for the fast pace! If you want a job that never changes, go be a <del>librarian</del> <del>doctor</del> <del>lawyer</del> gardener.
<br />
<br />
Which language should you pick? You have two big categories to choose from that I suggest:
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">The popular</li>
	<li dir="ltr">The exotic</li>
</ul>
<br />
The popular languages have significantly more, and a greater variety of jobs. On the down side, you also have more competition from other developers, and most of them have been using that language since before they were born. To stand out here, you need something to differentiate yourself from the other candidates: a unique perspective, skill in another programming paradigm, an ability to quickly learn new things, rapidly change contexts, etc. Figure out what your unique contributions are, and communicate them clearly.
<br />
<br />
Alternatively, on the exotic route, you pick an up-and-coming language, the new hotness, as it were. Because it is so new, there are much fewer jobs in this language, and less long-term stability. Consequently, there are also much fewer experienced developers. Savvy companies using this language will hire interested developers, despite them lacking any experience with it. (All your hard work in step two will really pay off here.)
<br />
<br />
Having chosen a language, now it’s time to learn it! Fill your github with work in that language.
 Read some books on it. Look for ways to use it at your current job. If your situation allows, start a big side project in it. You don&#8217;t HAVE to open-source the code on github, but this certainly helps to publicize your learning. Companies seek prior job experience to avoid having to pay to train you; well then, beat them to the punch by already knowing it!
<br />
<br />
To build your network, go to meetups and get involved in them. I cannot emphasize this enough.
 Stick out your hand and introduce yourself. Make connections with the people you meet. Learn about the tools people use at their work. You will begin to think like a developer in that stack as you’re exposed to new concepts. Soon enough, you will develop a sense of what companies are hiring and who would give you a recommendation at their company.
<br />
<br />
Mind your attitude when interviewing. Resist the urge to cynically compare and contrast the old and new stacks. I have interviewed too many candidates who could not stop talking about how great their old language is, or how “these new hipster languages are just a fad”. While you are certainly always entitled to your opinion, (who knows, you may even be right!), carrying on like this in an interview setting never leaves a good impression.
<br />
<br />
Perhaps you’re thinking that this is just too much effort. Just like everything in life, choosing not to move is also a valid move. I like to call it &#8220;riding into the sunset&#8221;. In this option, you never leave your language, ever. Though this may feel like the safer choice right now, it carries its own risks. If you hate maintenance projects, you need to learn to love them, because they are going to be your bread and butter. But, you will be competing for these projects with all the other sunsetters, and there are going to be a lot of them. From what I have heard, however, once you have reached the point where there are more maintenance jobs than there are remaining developers, you really do get to write your own ticket, but this can take decades. My great uncle did this, and he managed to stay employed in COBOL till he retired.
<br />
<br />
While escaping from your stack requires effort, by following the steps you can achieve it in just a few hours a week. So, get out there and do it!

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[How to Suck Less at Your New Job]]></title>
    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/new-job-todo-list/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/new-job-todo-list</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One thing I strongly recommend to developers when starting at a new job is to keep a list of everything that bothers you.</p>

<p>For every new company you work at, there will always be a set of things that you see as pain points, because you came from a place that did those things differently.</p>

<p>Notice I said differently, not better.</p>

<p>All of us have certain irrational attachments to the various things we are used to doing: things we do not because it’s the best way to do them, but because it’s become comfortable to do them that way. I have seen new developers come onto a team and complain endlessly about something that is clearly a net benefit for them and the team. However, the team is so used to doing it their way that they cannot imagine changing.</p>

<p>Allow me to share a personally painful example.</p>

<p>Much to my regret, when I moved into .NET development coming from the scripting world, I complained non-stop about how annoying it was to have to assign a type to everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><p>“I mean, in perl and php we got along great without it, so why on earth should anyone have to go through all this extra hassle?”</p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t realize how strong typing enabled very powerful tooling, and to be perfectly honest, I probably didn’t care. However, I did realize that my complaints were falling on deaf ears. My co-workers, who had never even looked at a dynamically typed language before, didn’t care. Much worse, I was alienating myself from them, becoming<em> that guy</em>, the one who just complains all the time. I sucked.</p>

<p>So, I decided on a new policy. Whenever something offended my sensibilities, seeming worse, wrong or just different, I would document it in a to-do list (I use <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> in emacs, because it’s mind-alteringly cool). I would stop complaining about it, stop making sidelong hints at it. I would just add it to the list. Apparently, I was pretty opinionated about how to make that team better, because that list grew monstrously large in just a few months.</p>

<p>Next, I would review that list every week. Whenever I had downtime I would pick something small and try to implement whatever I needed to make that work, things like:  like installing a CI server, or figuring out how to unit test this crazy actionscript fla.</p>

<p>If an issue was too large or I lacked the understanding to resolve all at once, I would do root cause analysis and brainstorm different ways to achieve the goal. Sometimes, I would take something off the list, either because it was too costly to justify its value, or because sometimes I realized I was grossly incorrect in my understanding of the issue.</p>

<p>So, back to my example about static typing. After about a year, I realized there was no way I could reasonably argue it was worth a change. No one but me cared, no one was interested in<a href="http://deliberate-software.com/how-to-escape-from-programming_language/" target="_blank"> learning new languages to try to use for development</a>, and the cost to convert anyway would have been staggering (and conversion was likely impossible).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I learned that while static typing is a cost of doing business in some languages, statically-typed languages lead the modern pack for powerful refactoring tooling (at least ‘til Yegge’s team finishes their quest for the Holy Grail (the <a href="https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4vQtz">Grok Project</a>; search that post for grok. And I said modern tools, so no smalltalk flame!)). My arguments advocating a change basically fell into two categories:: “I like it better”, and, “you won’t miss those refactoring and intellisense tools much”. You can imagine my co-workers’ reaction to either category: *Sad trombone*. Good thing I was keeping them all to myself in my to-do list.</p>

<p>This process, this simple change, powerfully changed my behavior and attitude. I am convinced that it helped me to mature, both socially and as a developer. No longer was I the whiny developer looking to his team lead to “kiss his boo-boos”, I was learning to weigh cost/benefits of both my short- and long-term goals for that team.</p>

<p>I also discovered a serendipitous side-effect from my todo-list. After about a year and a half when all the pain points had grown calloused, I was able to look back over my list for outstanding reminders of points of our process, still needing refinement. It was a way for me to reconnect with my <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?BeginnersMind">beginners mind</a>, and it was very helpful.</p>

<p>Since I started this process have I been able to participate in many discussions about an idea, article, or pain point another developer had mentioned where I have already thought through my position, because it is either something I have already noticed and have been working on a solution for, or I have been researching it, or I concluded (from my limited perspective) it wasn’t worth the effort.</p>

<p>Not many people reflect this deeply or have their thoughts so organized on important subjects affecting their work. It would make a powerful impression were you to find yourself involved in a hallway discussion with your boss about training, and you could nonchalantly add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><p>“Oh, new hire training. Yes, I have been considering how we train new hires for a long time, and I have a few ideas here on what would help our particular needs.”</p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, a few times something I had previously concluded wasn’t worth the effort due to internal political reasons suddenly has become possible, and I have been able to lead the group in that new endeavor, having spent effort considering and concluding how to best implement it.</p>

<p>When you find yourself complaining about the pain of a new job, don’t be a whiner. Don’t try to bully the other developers into doing things according to your “obviously better” way. Write your pain points down and start planning how you can truly impact your team for the best.</p>

Institutional ego is most often to blame.</span><p /> <span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">EDD plagues many organizations; here just some of the symptoms you might encounter:</span><p /> </p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><li style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">&#8220;Not Invented Here&#8221; syndrome:</span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> Expressed most commonly in a desire for everything needed to be developed in house. E.g.: &ldquo;Need a CMS? Let&rsquo;s make our own from scratch!&rdquo; Perhaps, you work at a place where all your teammates do is constantly bring you bad ideas. Are they really all terrible? &nbsp;Or are only your ideas good enough for the organization? Not Invented Here can also apply to your own head, not just the organization.</span></li><li style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> <span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Little to no test coverage of domain logic:</span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> There are plenty of great developers who do not need automated tests to remember all the little quirks of their systems when working alone, and that works fine until you bring on a second developer. Domain logic tests are about increasing communication and speed</span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> for the team</span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">, and they are part of being a good citizen of a team.</span></li><li style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">No dedicated UI person for external user interfaces or no actual user testing:</span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> Either the developers or the manager think they are good enough to design excellent and understandable user interfaces or do not realize the importance of this. Think of a &#8220;Steve Jobs&#8221;-type manager who imagines himself to be a prodigy of design and usability, or the developer who &#8220;doesn&#8217;t think design is all that hard&#8221;. Real users trying out your software for a few minutes will tell you more than you would believe.</span></li><li style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> <span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">No dedicated QA for externally-facing software:</span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> Someone who is experienced at breaking software should have a crack at it </span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">before </span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">it goes to users. Developers (including me) are too enamored with their own work to really take the time to break it, so someone with a sense of pride in finding problems needs to be given the task.</span></li><li style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> <span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">&#8220;</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Tower"><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#1155cc;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;vertical-align:baseline;">Ivory Tower</span></a><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">&#8221; or &#8221;</span><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html"><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#1155cc;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;vertical-align:baseline;">Architecture Astronaut</span></a><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">&#8221; team leads: </span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">The team member that is focused on &#8220;perfection&#8221; of the design or code to the detriment of the business. This is not an easy distinction to make, and no one becomes this without a heart full of good intentions. &#8220;If only the test coverage could be higher&#8221; (when it is already high) or &#8220;we can make our own programming language to solve this so much more elegantly&#8221;. Like I said, a fine line that takes many years of experience and deep familiarity with the business and the domain to discern.</span></li><li style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> <span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Broad skill level spectrum (that stays static):</span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> A huge gap in skill level between the best and worst team members. Most often happens when a bunch of new hires come on board, and were not skilled enough for the task or were not trained properly. The original team members decide the new members are &#8220;not worth the effort&#8221; and neglect to train them in the hopes they will be fired. Months, or even years later, the &#8220;new members&#8221; are still struggling along, berated by the &#8220;elites&#8221;.</span></li><li style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> <span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">No pair programming:</span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> Very few activities will raise the water level for all the team members like pairing.

Some tickets will be crammed with detail down to the database column names, others will be one-liners covering a month of work. Typically, this is a top-down effect, starting at upper management and trickling down to the lowest levels. Whatever the &#8220;eye of Sauron&#8221; is focused on is what the whole chain of command suddenly turns its laser focus towards, while the rest of the projects/tickets are abandoned by all but the developer assigned to the ticket.</span></li><li style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> <span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Agile &ldquo;Lite&rdquo;:</span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> Everyone pretty much has heard that agile is a fast development methodology. What often happens is that management either does not learn enough about it to implement correctly, or does not like the &#8220;chaotic&#8221; nature of true agile, and so attempts to adopt the &#8220;best parts&#8221;. Typically this means splitting work into &#8220;sprints&#8221; and having a &#8220;stand-up&#8221;, while developers all just work off of tickets assigned and estimated by their leads. Often this happens because the person who makes the call on whether or not to implement agile falsely believes themselves (and the team) to be &#8220;good enough to not need it&#8221;.</span></li><li style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> <span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Low</span><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html"><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> </span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#1155cc;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;vertical-align:baseline;">Joel Test</span></a><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> score:</span><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"> The Joel Test remains a great indicator of institutional ego. A team that scores low on the Joel Test does so because someone along the way decided that, &#8220;nah, we don&#8217;t need that here, we are special&#8221;, and almost certainly they are not.

This one is hard, because it really is almost always up to just one person, and the developer usually only gets to vote with their feet: by either staying or going. If you are that person, you had best consider what you are missing out on by remaining in a positon where you are underpaid.<br /></span></li></ul><p><br /> <span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Ego driven development is unfortunately self-reinforcing.

I have seen managers take tremendous crap from above, and never let a bit of it touch those below them. Those managers were heroes we all fought to impress, because we knew how hard they worked to make our teams better. I have seen experienced developers swallow their pride, and do the boring, tedious, hard, and less fun work for the betterment of the whole, in the process grew into someone much more productive.</span><p /> <span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">EDD is possible to defeat. Treat everyone with respect, and praise what steps they do take in the right direction. Set aside your ego, and when you get micro-managed and treated with disdain from those above you, do what it takes to make sure that doesn&#8217;t trickle down to those below you and at your level. Pick a few things on this list that you know you are not doing well, and tackle the root cause. Swallow your pride, and do your part to be excellent, and your work will thrive. </span></p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Learn That New Programming Language The Startup Way: For Intermediate Devs]]></title>
    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/learn-that-new-programming-language-the-start/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/learn-that-new-programming-language-the-start</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a method I use for rapidly learning new programming languages that I wanted to share because I have not really seen it documented anywhere else. This technique is not for the faint of heart, but it is a lot of fun. Many of you old hands and graybeards probably already do this, but for those that don&#8217;t, you have got to give it a shot at least once. You&#8217;ll never be the same. And no, I am not talking about <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, although that has its place.</p><p>First, do a bit of research, and get your hands on the best book on the language you can find. Second, research the language, and pick a project to which it is well suited. For example, to learn Clojure, I decided to re-write an old php project from scratch that I was well familiar with. (This also gives me the neat data point of seeing how much smaller the project is in Clojure)&nbsp;Try not to be too ambitious here, you want something you could pull off in your current go-to language.</p><p>Start the project, and work under a dozen hours on it, bashing your way through the first pains of installing the language/framework (my least favorite part), and getting a basic proof of concept together. If it&#8217;s a web site, think &#8220;hello world&#8221; coming out of your database of choice. Tell all your friends what you are going to make, and when it is launching. Make sure the launch date is ambitious. Start to read the book splitting your time roughly 25/75 between reading and programming, using what you read to provide you with &#8220;ammunition&#8221; for your project. Do this in as short a loop as possible, so the reading and programming are never far apart.</p><p>Since you will be fighting through real problems, the reading is a hundred times more interesting. Almost every page you will have to stop yourself from shouting, &#8220;OF COURSE!&#8221; out loud at the book, because you have just discovered something that is an extremely real pain point to you. <span>You may find yourself laughing more than once in sheer delight</span> because you anticipated a part of the language correctly, and just found the syntax for it. If that is not happening, you probably need to adjust the ratio of programming to reading. You want to find that sweet spot of just barely learning what you need to succeed, and constantly being &#8220;saved&#8221; by reading that last tidbit last night. If even the simplest things take unpleasantly long, perhaps more reading. If the reading is dragging too much, try more programming. When you hit that sweet spot, the programming is an exhilarating rush, and the reading is actually fun. If none of these happen, perhaps you are learning a language that does not really teach you anything new, just a different syntax for the same thing you are used to doing, in which case, ask yourself why you are learning that language. There are plenty out there that will <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">blow your mind</a>.</p><p>Don&#8217;t forget that deadline either, your friends and family are waiting, remember? Hustle is the name of the game here, and don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll make tons of mistakes, and you&#8217;ll never forget a single one. Who cares? (No one will ever know but you!) If experience is learning from a lot of mistakes, you&#8217;ll be the most experienced person around!</p><p>When that deadline looms, don&#8217;t give up! Step up your game, slash the second-best features, and race for the finish. If you are way off your mark, you can consider pushing the date back, but still deliver something on your original date. Once you are done, unwind for a few months, take it easy, then repeat. After a couple of those iterations you will be seriously more experienced in a wide variety of languages, and you will find yourself much more confident in your language-that-pays.</p><p>Do this a couple of times and you&#8217;ll not only get better at that language, you&#8217;ll get better at all of them. You will start to see the underlying concepts that cause languages to be written the way they are. The language families will start to run together, and you will develop the intuition of what you need to do with just the trivial task of remembering (or looking up) the syntax. Your programming skill will move to a higher plane of abstraction, and you will think outside the specific language. The language just becomes an implementation detail, just words that tell the compiler or interpreter what you mean. Reading other people&#8217;s code will become significantly easier, and you will find learning a new language is almost faster reading the masters&#8217; code on github than with a book at all.</p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> <span>Don&#8217;t let what little time you have discourage  you. A few minutes a day sneaking in one more function is better than a  few minutes a day moping in front of the TV wishing you had more time  for programming. </span>I understand not everyone can put in &#8220;this kind of time&#8221; (or energy) into side projects. Heck, plenty of times I cannot either. Sometimes, you only have a few hours a month on the good months. That&#8217;s fine. Take that date, stretch it out to the end of the year. Slip in that reading on the ride home, or at lunch. Make every moment you spend on it count.</p>

    <updated>2012-02-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/on-developer-certifications</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have often thought whenever I meet a programmer who is obviously grossly incompetent that there needs to be some sort of certification board for software engineering that can help enforce some minimal skills to help weed out the riff-raff.<p /> Obviously, this is completely impossible. The tools and community change so fast that individuals are barely able to stay on top; good luck getting a standards committee to completely revise every few months. Who would be on the committee? And what would they agree on to enforce? Regex? Recursion, OO, testability, and functional programming?&nbsp; Proof of understanding in the half-dozen <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html" target="_blank">&#8220;mind expanding&#8221;</a> languages? Not going to happen. Not while my Joomla-site maintaining friend and my Android 3D game authoring cohort are both lumped under the title &#8220;software developer&#8221;. The field is too vast, the content too broad, and the jobs too diverse. <p /> So, we are doomed to wallow. Or are we? What is the one thing we all have to do?<em> Get hired.</em><p />I used to be a big sissy about interviewing for jobs. Especially interviews full of the nit-picky details I can never remember, yeah, I <em>really</em> hate those. I would moan and groan about how the interviewer could only answer those questions because they had to look them up the other day. &#8220;MySQL index implementations, what am I, a DBA?!&#8221;, I would screech to anyone who would listen, &#8220;They must have misunderstood, I am a developer, when would I ever need to know that?!&#8221;<p /> But.<p />Interview prep gets me to cram stuff into my head I would otherwise skim or avoid if just sitting at home programming for fun. I get a great refresher on all the stuff I am fully able to do at work, but maybe I haven&#8217;t needed in a while. Like linked-lists. In four years of fairly diverse programming jobs, I have<strong> yet</strong> to need a linked list for anything, but man, when that day comes, I have linked-lists in a quick-draw holster. I used to say the same thing about trees, then last year, I had a problem that surely needed a tree, and hear you me, I had that data being in-order traversed before you could say: &#8220;tree&#8221;. Would I have even <em>remembered</em> <em>what trees are good for</em> without my semi-annual refresher?<p /> My wife is a commercial pilot, and every so often she is required to skim over all those little details about being a pilot, refreshing <em>everything</em>, double-checking her knowledge so she can keep her licenses, <em>even if she hasn&#8217;t needed a certain technique since the last test</em>. Huh. Sounds like me, every so often, cramming for an interview.<p />  We don&#8217;t need certifications for being a programmer. We already have the tools in hand, and just need to learn to use them better. <strong>Interviews are our certifications. </strong></p><p>This is a double-edged sword, because this means that, &#8220;what you sow, you will also reap&#8221;.  The responsibility to keep standards high falls on the interviewer. If  you interview a candidate for tricky puzzle questions, or in-depth  knowledge of C++ libraries, you will find someone who knows those  things, and possibly ONLY knows those things. I have seen developers hired who couldn&#8217;t handle VCS merging or shipping actual software, but were absolute <em>geniuses</em> when it came to programming language trivia and puzzle questions.</p><p>A few months ago, I read of a guy with no programming experience who did like 100 interviews in a few weeks, till he was a master interviewee. By the end, he was able to pick his choice of companies, and <strong>yet </strong><strong>he couldn&#8217;t ship software</strong>. He gamed a system <em>intended</em> to sort out good developers by asking questions that are ancillary to development, without actually having the candidate <em>prove any real ability</em>. And now that company has a developer who is great at gaming systems, but unskilled at development: I hope they have a good training program.</p><p>No offense intended to the man who did this, I <strong>really </strong>admire his tenacity and clever thinking, and I think he will do well regardless of the task. But it speaks volumes to the brokenness of the interview system for those companies that would hire a completely unskilled developer based on the correct answers to trivia questions about programming.</p><p>Parting question to consider for interviewers: if interviews are our certifications, what should a candidate be able to do to be &#8220;certified&#8221; to be able to do the job in question?</p>

    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/quality-is-future-speed/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/quality-is-future-speed</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I have been deliberating on <strong>quality</strong> <strong>vs. speed</strong>. Throughout my career, I have worked with developers who basically consider quality to be a programmer&#8217;s vice, an extravagance only for the navel-gazing idealists. I have also worked with developers who consider <em>all </em>time spent on quality to be of the utmost importance, and that programming for speed is for those lazy and slapdash realists. I recently read Yegge&#8217;s post <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html">Done, and Get&#8217;s Things Smart</a>, and I think I agree with Yegge on this point, that it <em>is</em> possible to perform fast and with high quality, and like a wandering samurai, that is the path I seek. <p />  There are many facets to this, of course, but I have been playing with this mental model. Specifically, my insight here is a new definition of quality: <strong>quality is future speed</strong>. In my mind, quality that is not for future speed <strong>is</strong> an extravagance, something programmers do to entertain themselves, and it is worse than cutting corners in the present, because it sacrifices current work for no future gain. <p />  Lately, my personal projects have taken a certain theme: I want more practice tuning my programming to be as fast as possible <em>both for today and for the future</em>. And to be perfectly honest, usually there is a lot more &#8220;future&#8221; in most systems than just &#8220;today&#8221;. <p />  So, how have I been doing this? I set arbitrarily short deadlines for myself, so I am forced to practice dropping anything that is not directly related to speed. I then try to rotate projects every month, so I am forced to return to old work, to learn better where I made bad choices that cost me <em>future </em>speed. <p />  Doing this with the right mindset is very humbling, and very insightful. Honestly, this may happen at work accidentally from time to time as well, but rarely at work am I able to carefully reflect on the mistakes of the past. At home, the pain I feel is my own, no one suffers at home other than me, and there is no one to blame but myself. If an architecture is brittle, or the test coverage is low, or the design is resistant to change, (all of which have happened) I am able to take those lessons to heart <em>because I directly caused those problems</em>.<p />  I encourage anyone who, like me, seeks to be a more excellent developer, to give this a try: start a couple of side projects (and don&#8217;t worry, it took me a year to get the ones I have), and set yourself some crazy tight &#8220;delivery dates&#8221;. Heck, make real products and try to make some money off them, maybe you will be able to get some side-cash! But then, after you have &#8220;delivered&#8221;, take some time to rest, maybe read a book or two, tinker with some other projects, and after a break, return to analyze your past work. Set yourself another strict deadline, try to make a second version, or add some more features. You will find some incredibly valuable lessons there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>December 1st, I made myself a New Year&#8217;s resolution to completely create an Android game that I would not be ashamed to show people from (mostly) scratch before the end of December. What made it the most fun was that I started with practically no experience with the Android platform at all, and so I got to pick it up by the seat of my pants.<p />The biggest challenge was probably the last three days, where I was faced with some hard calls, when the deadline loomed, and my still mile-long list of wants had to be pruned down just about every few hours. I basically had a &#8220;buggy beta&#8221; by Wednesday morning, and all the problems remaining were ones I didn&#8217;t know how to solve or hide, and while all the graphics where there, I could barely stand to look at them. I felt like I was spinning my wheels with no progress. My friend Dan tried to talk me down, pointing out with some clarity that there was no gun to my head, and I was doing this for myself, so I could stop any time. Amusingly enough, that was exactly what I needed to hear. I was doing this for myself, to better myself, to learn more discipline. I wanted to stretch my abilities to the limits. So, I pushed through. I found a book that showed me how to fix my problems, and I didn&#8217;t stop until every bug I could find was fixed, and everything my poor family pointed out (I made them each play it like a dozen different times) was smoothed.<p />  And last night, after about a hundred hours of total work this month, I slid under the wire with roughly two hours to spare. The game is not in the market YET, because at the end of it all, I concluded I would rather spend the few dozen more hours to convert it to OpenGL ES, and add in a few neat things I was unable to do using the Android canvas, but for a v1, I am immensely proud of the whole experience.<p />I can say, unequivocally; WHEW. <p />This challenge was a fantastic learning experience, and I had several great reminders of what my dad always told me growing up: <strong>just work smarter, son, not harder</strong>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t get focused today. My mind is a torrent of activity completely unrelated to my task at hand, so I am writing this to get these thoughts out so I can get back to work.<p />I got a call from a recruiter the other day trying to get me to come interview at this job. Right now I am working in VB.NET and Actionscript. Until this job, I was always working in open-source languages: Perl, PHP, and some Java. This is my first real divergence from that pattern, and of course it is in two languages that are, to say the least, not very popular with the open source crowd. This gets me wondering, &#8220;what if when I decide to move on, all the fun jobs look down their noses at me for working in unpopular languages?&#8221;.<p /> To be fair, I still program quite a bit outside work in my favorite languages, and that is all well and good.<p />For some reason though, that recruiter really got under my skin. I keep asking myself questions like, &#8220;is spending time right now making a Java game for the Android a good choice long term?&#8221; or, &#8220;should I spend any more time learning Python with Django, or just get more invested in Javascript and node.js?&#8221;.<p /> These are not questions I want to be asking myself. <p />So, I sit down to think about it and get it out of my system. What kind of programmer do I want to be in 5 years? I know without a moment&#8217;s hesitation. <p /> <strong>I want to be the kind of programmer who is not tied to any one language or platform, but is instantly effective and rapidly excellent in </strong><strong><em>every</em> language and platform. </strong><p />Right now, I am learning Common Lisp. Why? To learn better functional programming. Why do I play with Javascript? To be better at client-side web programming. PHP/Python? Server-side web programming. *.NET? Compiled, versioned programming. Android games? For fun! Why do I all this? Because the programmer I want to be is not constrained to his language/platform<em> at all</em>. The programmer I want to be programs at a level <em>over the language</em>.&nbsp;</p>

    <updated>2011-09-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/testing-is-to-programming-what-math-is-to-eng</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
  In ancient times, plenty of builders did their work without math,
  and I would guess that a good portion of them likely did it faster
  then their math-doing counterparts.
</p>
<p >
  I am certain that when builders first started using math to prove
  that buildings would stand up safely, they were mocked by their
  math-less counterparts. I can hear them now, &#8220;Oh, Stephos, it takes
  you 5 times longer to prove your building will stand up, real men
  can just <em>see</em> that it will work&#8221;. Even in modern times, many
  people build houses and small buildings that probably don&#8217;t even
  need the math to really &#8220;prove&#8221; they work, but they perform the due
  diligence anyway. On the other hand, some people today still build
  houses, sheds, tree-houses, lofts, and fire pits without any
  drawings or math at at all, and why should they? They are
  responsible for the risk.
</p>
<p >
  This is all fine, but, builders who shy away from math also don&#8217;t
  build airliners, space shuttles, and skyscrapers. An aircraft
  designer who doesn&#8217;t feel like using math to prove their aircraft
  will fly is handed an &#8220;Experimental&#8221; sticker and gravely patted on
  the back.
</p>
<p >
  Today, programming is at the same place as both
  ancient <strong>and</strong> modern engineering: many projects can
  be done &#8220;by eye&#8221;, and some of the most experienced programmers are
  able to build immense projects alone without any sort of automated
  testing at all. When you go to a forum and ask for help, you are
  just as likely to hear from a &#8220;space shuttle&#8221; programmer as you are
  to hear from a &#8220;tin shack&#8221; programmer. The &#8220;space shuttle&#8221;
  programmer would be horrified to hear of working without automated
  testing and rigorous review practices, whereas the &#8220;tin shack&#8221;
  programmer would be horrified to think of the time wasted to
  even <em>learn the procedures</em> to automatically prove his code
  works as it should. The &#8220;space shuttle&#8221; programmer might work on the
  same internal financial project for months or years, finally
  releasing with zero defects; the &#8220;tin shack&#8221; programmer might churn
  out several quick web sites a day. Neither project
  is <em>better</em> then the other, they both might be perfect for
  what their business needs.
</p>
<p>
  I have heard several times from very good lone wolf programmers that
  testing just slows them down, and in some ways, it does appear to be
  a slowdown for them. Unfortunately, the cost to build even
  medium-sized projects with several workers without automated testing
  is only felt when it is too late, when the deadlines (and costs) are
  spiraling out of control.
</p>
<p>
  The disciplined application of mathematics transformed and
  solidified the field of engineering into a field far more vast and
  capable of some of the most incredible constructions imaginable.
  Would we have smart-phones, GPS, modern cars, and airliners if
  engineering had just avoided mathematics? Just imagine what the
  field of programming could grow into if we continue to learn and
  grow our testing, designing, and writing of software.
</p>
<p>
  I propose that automated testing is to programming what math was
  to ancient engineering.

    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/the-endless-debate</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><br />The last three and a half years for me have been terrible. Why? Well, three and half years ago, I discovered the endless debate, Emacs vs. Vim. Being an efficiency nut, I could not fathom the horror of learning one, and by that action, not learning the other. What if the one I learned was not the &#8220;best&#8221; one? I could see that both were excellent and worth learning, but I wanted to learn both concurrently. Unfortunately, my body has a hard time learning two completely different keyboard systems at the same time. Heck, three and a half years ago, I was still learning to touch-type. <p /> So, three years pass, and I am now no farther along. <p />Additionally, I read on an almost weekly basis, articles that explain how great Emacs and vim are, you just need to learn one, and learn it well. I wanted to stick with Emacs, for the built-in lisp, and <a href="http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/3996068979/the-levels-of-emacs-proficiency">several</a> of my <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/effective-emacs">favorite</a> programmers highly advocate it. But, I wanted to pick up vim, because it is obviously the far superior text editor, and the default on Linux, and probably will help me not get Emacs <a href="http://xahlee.blogspot.com/2010/06/famous-emacs-people-with-hand-injuries.html">RSI</a> but, perversely, it is not nearly as easy to extend as Emacs. <p /> So, the debate raged in my head for three years, and I stupidly got better at neither. Then, the other day, it clicked. Vim is the greatest text editor of them all, with text objects, highly combine-able commands, and modal editing. Emacs is the greatest IDE of all, with an awesome programming language built-in and thousands of classes and libraries to build on. Vim is built in the tradition of a small, sharp UNIX tool; Emacs in the tradition of HAVING thousands of small sharp tools. <p /> Finally, in a rush, it clicked into place with earth-shattering force: I can make Vim inside Emacs, with lisp, but I really could not remake Emacs inside Vim. <p />Suddenly, in one glorious moment, the world all made sense. Vim, the greatest text editor, should be a part of Emacs, the greatest IDE! My searching had been in vain, there was no way to compare them, they are totally different tools!<p /> In my typical child-like innocence, I rolled up my sleeves, opened up an instance of Emacs, and started making Vim. A few hours later, Google pointed out the obvious: Emacs already has a vi mode built-in (viper). Better yet, with a simple file in the right place, I had <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-es/Vimpulse">vimpulse </a>(the practically complete Vim mode) installed and ready to go. Suddenly, a huge weight lifted off my chest. I am free to use the best tool for the job, and, like Huck Finn, float off down the river, leaving silly feuds behind me. If my actions here seem unnatural, an abomination, an unholy union, I encourage you, leave behind the fan-boyism, pick up your tools, and come build something with men who see their tools for what they truly are: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not a good hill to die on</span>.</p>

    <link href="http://steveshogren.github.io/end-to-end-web-service-testing/"/>
    <updated>2011-06-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveshogren.github.io/end-to-end-web-service-testing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
  At work last month, I was assigned to fix some bugs in an
  asynchronous legacy code base. My supervisor gave me a month to see
  what I could do, and to see if I could fix a few tricky bugs. The
  code is divided into two sections, a client application and a web
  server. Both the client application and the server have their own
  persistence, and they communicate through a soap web service.
</p>
<p>
  I wanted to try and write some sort of end-to-end tests around this,
  but I could not figure out how to get around that web service. I
  don&#039;t want my tests to rely on a server having to always be up,
  so I initially was planning on writing tests from the client
  database to the web service, where I would just stub some responses.
  I got about an hour into that plan, before I realized I would then
  have to do that same thing on the server, and that sort of testing
  will not really tell me what the code <i>does</i>. I needed to cover
  this whole process end-to-end.
</p>
<p>
 I walked around for a bit, thinking. Then it hit me, both the server
 and client code are written in VB.NET, and, except for the web service, work
 just like plain old highly-coupled code. Hmmm.
</p>
<p>
 For the first pass, I wrote an interface to wrap the web service,
 then used dependency injection to inject a fake web service that (and
 here is the cool part) simply calls around the web service entirely
 to the server code directly and injects a different database
 connection string, so the server talks to a second database I have
 prepared.
</p>
<p>
 Just like that, I can run, all on my machine, 99 percent of the code
 in a single end-to-end test. I can even setup several client
 databases, and rotate them out, to &quot;swap&quot; between several
 clients in the middle of the tests.
</p>
<p>
 I added a few &quot;integration&quot; tests that do talk to a real
 published testing web service, just to make sure everything is still
 in place correctly.
</p>
<p>
  Now, I said this was asynchronous, and it is, the executed
  system-under-test kicks off a thread to talk to the web service, and
  so to get it to test, I needed to wait for the thread to finish,
  then do my assertions.
</p>
<p>
 I used a system where the spun off thread will set a boolean when it
 has finished running, to let the main thread know it has finished,
 and the main thread just keeps checking that boolean until it is
 true. While hackish, that is my current working solution, as no more
 then one thread is ever spun off at a time, I can just have my test
 wait for the thread to finish, then complete the required assertions.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
  So, working through the Land of Lisp book, getting the hang of it.
</p>
<p>
Chapter Six, the author starts off by talking a little about
  the Common Lisp REPL, or Read-Eval-Print-Loop that you use as sort
  of the &#8220;command line&#8221; for interacting with lisp. It is pretty cool,
  you type in code, and it executes. And then he opens the hood a
  little:
</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defun</span> <span class="nv">repl</span> <span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">loop </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">print </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">eval </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">read</span><span class="p">)))))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<p>
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA??!?!?!
</p>
<p>
I just about spit my drink all over the monitor laughing. The
function <strong>eval()</strong> evaluates whatever text is passed in
as code, in this case, from the command line via the obviously
named <strong>read</strong> and after executing
it, <strong>print()</strong> prints the result, and it just does that
forever till you quit.
</p>
<p>
That means, you could make one of these for any language that can
evaluate strings into code. I know python has one built-in. Php can
evaluate code with eval, and a quick search shows a highly nifty (and
robust from the looks of
it) <a href="https://github.com/facebook/phpsh">REPL for php</a>
complements of facebook. Sweet. Or, you can use php -a for the
interactive mode.

reiteration. Until chapter 20, that is. I get to the section Don&#8217;t
Mock Concrete Classes, and it clicks.
</p>
<p>
 Mocking concrete classes used to be my bread and butter. Almost every
 unit test I wrote for the last year had several mocked concrete
 implementations, to pass in as dependencies of the system under test.
</p>
<p>
What do I mean by that? Imagine a class that takes one dependency
through the constructor like this:

</p>
<p>
For several months now, writing unit tests this way has become
increasingly irritating to me, for several reasons. First off, notice
how phpunit does a mock? With a string for the classname and the
method to mock. Obviously, in small scale this duplication is
manageable, but imagine for a second thousands of unit tests all
mocking this way, and you will realize it gets out of hand fast. More
than once in the last year I have set out to refactor a classname or
method signature, to have dozens of failing unit tests, because they
all mock the <em>string</em> of the old name.
</p>
<p>
 Secondly, and more importantly, I find this to be brittle because you
 are locking yourself into an implementation of the class you need
 mocked. What if I wanted to move that getPaymentPerDay to a different
 class? Or I changed that version of getPaymentPerDay to
 getPaymentPerMonth? I would have to traipse through every one of
 those brittle mocks and rewrite their duplicated, crystalline
 structure.
</p>
<p>
 Stupid.
</p>
<p>
My inner frustration was so great as to cause me to start thinking up
all sorts of mad ways to get around this issue. Store the code needed
to build that mock as text on the class itself, to be parsed and
executed on the fly? Check. Create massive hierarchical testing
libraries to build the mocks? Check. And all these did was mask the
real issue. <strong>I was mocking the concrete
implementation.</strong>
</p>
<p>
 So, what would mocking the interface be? Well, PayoffCalc actually
 has two public methods: getPayoffDate() and getPaymentPerDay(). The
 Velocity class only needs getPaymentPerDay(), but by mocking the
 concrete class, we are forcing it to depend on
 the <strong>whole</strong> (undefined) interface of PayoffCalc.
 Velocity does not need getPayoffDate(), but it is in the interface we
 give it (in the form of the concrete PayoffCalc).
</p>
<p>
 Whoa. Sounds
 like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle"
 target="_blank">ISP</a>. Written about by Bob Martin. Fifteen years
 ago. *Forehead smack*
</p>
<p>
I make an interface for this concept of PaymentPerDayRetriever, for
lack of a
better <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RoleInterface.html"
target="_blank">Role</a>.
</p>
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="k">interface</span> <span class="nx">PaymentPerDayRetriever</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<p>
Then use the interface in the test:
</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<p>
By mocking the interface, I have freed my Velocity class from knowing
about the rest of the old PayoffCalc interface, and when I realize
later that my PayoffCalc really is doing two totally separate things,
I can just move the PaymentPerDayRetriever interface to
getPaymentPerDay&#8217;s new home (probably on the PaymentRepository, not
shown here).
</p>
<p>
 While this example only used one method per interface, in reality, it
 would have all the methods necessary to complete that aspect of the
 class.
</p>
<p>
Fascinating.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
  Up until recently, most of my programming was in php, which does not
  support named parameters
  (<a href="http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/webprog/pcook/ch06_05.htm"
  target="_blank">this</a> doesn&#8217;t count, and it will get you lynched)
  so while switching to VB.NET and python, I have come to really
  appreciate this handy feature.
</p>
<p>
 Named parameters is one of those handy little things that can make
  your life a little easier. Say, in python, you have a function that
  takes a boolean value. Normally, I would create a variable just to
  hold that boolean value, then pass it in, to try to be easier for
  the next guy to understand.

<p>
  Who knows what window&#8217;s parameter is? What the heck is true anyway,
  the window? <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/"
  target="_blank">PyCharm</a> knows (and if you are using python
  without it, I implore you to treat yourself to the demo) otherwise
  you have to look up the function <em>like a barbarian</em> to see
  what is going on. Sure, you can make it more clear with:

  Boom! Way easier to read, no extra variables hanging around making
  trouble. Many times I have made function parameters, called them one
  thing, then made a variable with a slightly different name to pass
  in for legibility, but no more of that crap! Now, when I have the
  inclination to make a variable just to clarify something, I just
  name the parameter and pass in the value right there, like a
  civilized gentleman should.

<p>
 Additionally, VB.NET has this too, with the slightly goofier
  syntax of the &#8220;:=&#8221;

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  My cohort Daniel Miladinov pointed out that this is calling the
  assignment operator directly, since calling it with just the equals
  would perform
  an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equals_sign#In_computer_programming">equality operator</a>. Smart guy, Dan.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to test a project that is huge and many of the
&quot;classes&quot; are only defined as linkages from the main monster
fla. I followed <a href="http://marstonstudio.com/2007/07/28/asunit-testing-with-flash-cs3-and-actionscript-3/" target="_blank">ASUnit Tutorial</a> and got it to work with their simple examples. But when I went to test a factory and child class I had just written (hey, I would have tdd&#039;d, but then I would not have know if it was failing for the right reason), it would not compile, hanging up on some of those undefined &quot;exported linkage&quot; classes. I could not find anything about that online, I assume because developers who would want to write unit tests wouldn&#039;t rely on those exported linkage classes anyway.<p /> After waiting for a day or two and moving on, I asked the guy who maintains this project. His knee-jerk solution? Call the new AsUnitTestRunner() right in the first line of the constructor for the main fla&#039;s class. I was skeptical at best, but it worked! My guess is those exported linkages are imported into the project scope through some sort of implicit import on the constructor of the class tied to the .fla with the linkages. Sheesh.<p /> Obviously, we want to start defining those exported linkage classes as actual code, so we can run our tests without un-commenting the new AsUnitTestRunner() and then building the project, but it is a start in the right direction.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am a lazy lazy man, and as such I do not like to waste time waiting for things or doing dumb stuff.<p />One place this is evident is in the browser. I like to know the cool shortcuts and tricks to speed me along my way, and Firefox has tons. Here are some neat tricks I learned this weekend.<p /> From anywhere in Firefox, <strong>Ctrl-k</strong> will take you to the &#8220;search bar&#8221; and <strong>Ctrl-L</strong> to the &#8220;address bar&#8221;, that is cool, but it gets better.<p />When opening a new tab (<strong>Ctrl+t</strong>) it always defaults your cursor to the address bar. Now many people would just say, &#8220;hey steve, don&#8217;t be a jerk, and just hit <strong>Tab</strong> to move to the search bar, then search.&#8221; This works, but I search for stuff all the time, and like to cut down on keys even further. <p /> So, I wanted to make the address bar search google for me. To do this, go to about:config, and change the <strong>keyword.URL</strong> value to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=0&amp;q=">http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=0&amp;q=</a> <p /> By default, if you type in &#8220;facebook&#8221;, Firefox will search google and redirect you to the &#8220;I&#8217;m Feeling Lucky&#8221; result, due to the gfns=1. The first result is <a href="http://facebook.com">facebook.com</a>, so that is where you go. But since much of what I type is real searching and not a url, I want to see the results! Changing your <strong>keyword.URL</strong> will still search google, but it will now take you to the results page, which saves me a few extra seconds each search. <p /> Now, in the rare case where I just want to go to Facebook.com, I pull another trick and just type &#8220;facebook&#8221; and then <strong>Ctrl-Enter</strong> which will pre-pend the &#8220;www.&#8221; and append the &#8220;.com&#8221;<p /> Wheew, in five to seven years, this might just have saved me the time I spent learning it.<p />Practicality: 2/10<br />Cool nerd learning: 9/10</p><p>EDIT - While this is cool, and I do have it working on my machines, I ended up muscle memorizing the longer but far more portable method of just <strong>Ctrl-t Tab</strong> or <strong>Ctrl-t Ctrl-k</strong>. I know this is not nearly as cool, but hey, if I can open and save a file in emacs, <em>I can do <span style="font-family:mceinline;">anything</span>.</em></p>
