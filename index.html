  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple years ago, a coworker told me a success story about mindful meditation.
He explained how his wife took a class that required an hour of daily meditation
for a whole month. He reported that she found it uncomfortable, but the effects
were astounding. She claimed to feel more relaxed, more focused, and more
&ldquo;herself&rdquo;. She found new reserves of motivation. She dropped the book she&rsquo;d been
trying to write for years, and started a business. After that business failed,
she started another, this time successfully.</p>

<p>Immediately convinced, I started by listening to guided
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness#Mindfulness_meditation">mindfulness meditations</a>
on YouTube and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/science">phone apps</a>. After a couple
weeks of that, I started doing breathing exercises on my own while sitting
listening to rain sounds. I made a habit of doing it for about an hour every day
on my lunch break. A few months later, I hated it.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, after each session I would feel very uncomfortable. I would
be confronted with emotions that made me feel worthless and embarrassed. My mind
was bringing forward all these painful memories and feelings. Over time, I
started to dread the lunch break.</p>

<h2>The Revelation</h2>

<p>Then, one day, I had a profound sense of understanding. I realized what was
causing these negative emotions. I was in the middle of a major push to guide
our team to adopt a new programming language. While I&rsquo;d led many such
initiatives before, I saw that I&rsquo;d always had the same struggles. My ego and
self-worth were so tied into &ldquo;my&rdquo; campaigns that I wasn&rsquo;t able to clearly hear
criticism. When people pointed out legitimate concerns or weaknesses, I would
get embarrassed and take it as a personal failure.</p>

<p>I could see, from the very beginning, my current &ldquo;campaign&rdquo; had been poorly
executed. After researching the new technology for a long time, I felt like I
saw a place where it could solve some of our needs. Instead of carefully writing
out a proposal, I &ldquo;half-jokingly&rdquo; brought it up whenever I could. When the
listeners didn&rsquo;t immediately react positively, I quickly retracted the idea,
&ldquo;just kidding&rdquo;. Over weeks I dropped not-so-subtle hints, &ldquo;this would be better
with&hellip;&rdquo;, or, &ldquo;we wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem if&hellip;&rdquo;. Instead of convincing
anyone of anything, I just broadcasted to everyone how insecure I felt about the
issue. Everyone could clearly see that I cared, but I was too afraid to put
myself out there and make a serious suggestion. For months nothing changed, and
I felt more and more bitter that &ldquo;my idea&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t being listened to. In reality,
I hadn&rsquo;t even made a serious suggestion yet!</p>

<p>Eventually, the people around me started to listen and research the new
language. They agreed it really did solve a need we had. After a while, enough
people got on board that we started using it more. Even then, I held tightly to
&ldquo;my idea&rdquo;, afraid that it would prove to be a failure. When someone ran into
issues, I would get defensive. Even though I tried to keep my emotions in check,
I clearly took any criticism of the language as if it was a personal failing, no
matter how legitimate. I&rsquo;d tightly coupled my ego to my ideas, and I always had.</p>

<p>After a few months of meditating, this idea rocked my world. My negative
emotions came from a realization that my actions were not in line with my
values. I don&rsquo;t want my self-worth to be tied to a simple tool. No tool is worth
it. Every tool fails. I&rsquo;d sold myself short, lowered my self-worth to that of a
tool. This completely blocked my ability to be an effective technical leader.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t hear criticism of my ideas without getting defensive, so I couldn&rsquo;t
think critically. I couldn&rsquo;t help work out solutions to the best of my ability,
because that would mean admitting personal failure. Every side comment or
momentary struggle felt like a catastrophe.</p>

<p>After realizing this, I felt a wave of relief. My emotional struggle leading
this programming language change made sense! And I had an easy way out! I simply
had to distance myself from my ideas, separate my self-worth from my tools. The
more I meditated, the easier it got.</p>

<h2>Present Day</h2>

<p>While I still sometimes get the old pang of embarrassment or defensiveness, now
I understand where it comes from, and how to move forward. I can let my ideas
go. I can consider ideas critically. I can make changes and adjustments if the
ideas are not working.</p>

<p>This summer I decided to write up my learning. I wanted to always be able to
look back and remember these important lessons. My write-up was the seed for the
book <a href="https://leanpub.com/convincingcoworkers">Convincing Coworkers</a>. I explain
the lessons learned from implementing a half dozen major technical changes, and
how I learned to lead without letting my ego cloud my thinking.</p>

<p>If you want to become a more effective leader, I highly recommend a practice of
daily meditation. Meditation gives your mind a chance to deeply consider your
actions and values. It allows your subconscious to reflect on what and why you
act.</p>

<p>Not everyone will struggle from the same issues as me. Every leader has a
different set of challenges and situations. Meditation lets your mind analyze
your unique weaknesses and strengths, coming up with a tailored perspective.
Meditating allows your mind to creatively look for ways to improve itself. While
rarely comfortable, this process can have incredible benefits.</p>

<h2>Appendix: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with the connotations of meditation&rdquo;</h2>

<p>You may feel uncomfortable with meditation because of its current strong
associations with religion. Meditation is not inherently religious. I consider
meditation like an exercise routine for the mind. If you are religious, and
exercise your body as a form of religious expression, exercise is a religious
practice. If you are not religious, and you exercise to improve your health and
well-being, exercise is a secular practice. Meditation is just a form of mental
exercise. Simple as that.</p>

<p>Meditation is a tool, and the tool wielder determines its use. Don&rsquo;t let a fear
of the connotations of meditation stop you from experiencing improved
leadership, creativity, and focus!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(All these great ideas, but no one is listening? Check out my
book: <a href="https://leanpub.com/convincingcoworkers">Convincing Coworkers</a>)</p>

<p>One day, I went into an interview, and I was humiliated.</p>

<h3>The Setup</h3>

<p>I used to think very highly of myself. This was early on in the Test Driven
Development (TDD) craze, and I was one of the best I knew at it. I knew
interfaces, classes, mocking frameworks, and best practices. I&rsquo;d been taught all
the tricks from some very smart people, and my confidence was high. Not only
that, but I&rsquo;d just finished at work the restoration of an abandoned legacy
codebase to a bug-free, fully tested state completely on my own.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d shipped Java, PHP, Perl, C#, and VB.NET, and I hadn&rsquo;t been programming more
than a couple years. My first job, they&rsquo;d made me a team lead over some very
senior developers within a year of my hire date. I was learning Clojure and
Common Lisp, and had just shipped an Android game I made entirely alone
(including the 2D physics engine).</p>

<p>I thought I was incredible. Yet, due to an overwhelming sense of Imposter
Syndrome, I keenly knew that there were things I didn&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m mostly self
taught, so a lot of common CS concepts felt alien. I was waking up before work
and teaching myself algorithms, lisps, and math.</p>

<p>Enter Company A.</p>

<p>I flew through the phone screen &ldquo;this is the best phone screen we&rsquo;ve seen!&rdquo; Of
course it is. &ldquo;Your resume is very impressive.&rdquo; Oh, I know!</p>

<p>I get to the on-site interview.</p>

<h3>The On-Site</h3>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t been thoughtful enough to ask what to wear, so I wore a suit. I was
asked to present a project I&rsquo;d worked on, and I picked my recently shipped
physics game that was up on Google Play. I walked into the reception area a few
minutes early.</p>

<pre><code>"You are 25 minutes late."
</code></pre>

<p>What?! I explain that I have the email saying 9:30! No matter, &ldquo;hurry, they are
waiting!&rdquo; Maybe I can salvage this. I walk into a conference room with a dozen
people sitting around a table looking bored and pissed.</p>

<pre><code>"Let's see your presentation."
</code></pre>

<p>I start to open up my laptop. Meanwhile they start to joke around to each other:</p>

<pre><code>"Oh, wow, Linux, what is this, 2003? I'd hoped I'd never have to see the
grub boot screen again! Can't you afford a real machine?"
</code></pre>

<p>I try to joke back while multitasking with my laptop. They only have the Mac
projector cable. No adapter. I&rsquo;d thought ahead, and handed one of the developers
a thumb drive with the presentation and code. Meanwhile the interviewers are
joking and laughing to each other at my choice of clothes.</p>

<pre><code>"A suit, classic, where are you interviewing after this, a sales job?"
</code></pre>

<p>I roll with it, make some joke about &ldquo;styling&rdquo;. I start presenting about the 2D
physics engine I&rsquo;d written as a learning project for my game. One of the most
interesting parts to me was how I&rsquo;d first written it without any unit testing,
following just Clean Code practices. I then re-wrote it using heavy TDD. The
design turned out very different both times, which I thought was interesting to
see how TDD had influenced the design.</p>

<p>About five minutes in, I am cut off:</p>

<pre><code>"This presentation is bullshit. You have no evidence, nothing valuable to
show, just spurious subjective opinions. You've put up a straw man and now
are trying to knock it down assuming we are idiots. I've seen enough."
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, it has been barely 15 minutes since I walked in. I remain calm
and professional, and start to address the raised concerns. I play the
meta-game, wondering if perhaps this is a test to see how I&rsquo;ll react when
questioned and embarrassed. Even if this wasn&rsquo;t a test, I was determined to be
at my most professional and finish with my head held high.</p>

<p>Five developers walk out before I can finish my first sentence. One of the
remaining six interviewers looks embarrassed and asks if I could live code them
a web scraper in any language instead of the presentation. I turn my laptop
around (still no projector) and ask if PHP is acceptable. They are a Python
shop, and PHP is the closest to what they use that I am comfortable using when
this nervous.</p>

<pre><code>"PHP? Gross. I suppose if it is all you know..."
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve got so much adrenaline in me that it takes me a few tries to
log in. I get on a roll after five minutes, and write the scraper. They throw me
a few more requirements, and within a half hour I&rsquo;ve written stories for and
completed them all. At least two of the interviewers seem quite impressed.
Someone looks at their watch, &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s all the stories we have, I guess
let&rsquo;s break for lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lunch is a 35 minute walk up a hill in humid 93F weather, and I am wearing a
suit and dress shoes. When we get back from lunch I am hot, tired, and
foot-sore. I distinctly remember my feet blistering inside my sweat-soaked
patent leather shoes. I am called into the conference room again. At this point,
I am genuinely curious if this is some sort of extreme patience/calmness test,
or if I am being filmed for a reality show. No such luck.</p>

<p>At the head of the table is the developer who &ldquo;called me out&rdquo; for my
presentation. Apparently my lunch mates were supposed to only take an hour, we
took almost 90 minutes. He looks at me, rolls his eyes, and asks in the most
sarcastic tone I have ever heard:</p>

<pre><code>"So, got any questions for me?"
</code></pre>

<p>I ask a few normal questions, meanwhile he is constantly checking his watch and
rolling his eyes. He answers briefly and rudely. I thank him for his time, and
ask him if there is more. He laughs.</p>

<pre><code>"Oh, we are done here."
</code></pre>

<p>I am shown to the door.</p>

<p>I sit in the car for a half hour, wondering what just happened. I look over to
the passenger seat piled high with text books I have been studying, books on
language design, compilers, algorithms, physics engines, TDD, and productivity.</p>

<p>I was asked none of it. I threw up from stress out the car door into their
parking lot.</p>

<h3>Aftermath</h3>

<p>I found out later their recruiter had given me and many other candidates the
wrong time. She was fired shortly after.</p>

<p>I never found out if I had done something to make everyone so angry. I now
suspect that they were massively turned off by a host of things. Polyglot
programming, practicing TDD, the suit, the not Mac, the late arrival, and a bad
presentation probably all contributed to an immediate disqualification. I
rationally realize they were terrible and treated me terribly, but the
embarrassment is still there. I suspect my presentation was terrible from the
get go: that they were expecting some rock-star and instead got me.</p>

<p>A number of times I have woken up in a cold sweat having dreamt about that
interview. In the large scheme of things, a bad interview is such a small thing,
but fear is fear. I still to this day wonder what I did wrong. Was I arrogant,
cocky, insufferable? Did my ego cause them to treat me that way, or was it all
them? What could I have done differently? I was only in there for a few minutes!</p>

<p>Few events in my professional life have shaped me as much as that interview. I
have turned it into a forge for my talent, the anvil on which I beat my pride.
When I don&rsquo;t know something, I am more willing to shrug and laugh it off, all
while learning as fast as I can. When I am humiliated professionally, I know
I&rsquo;ve come through worse and thrived.</p>

<h3>Break The Cycle</h3>

<p>This story fills me with an overwhelming desire to never continue the cycle of
abuse. I strive every interview to try to respectfully work with the candidate,
and never humiliate them. I want every person I interview to leave feeling loved
as a human and respected, even if they are completely incapable to perform the
duties of the job.</p>

<p>When I ask a question, if they struggle, we work it out together. When I ask for
code, we write it together, even if that means I have to do all the work. I can
make myself their servant, while still assessing their skill with accuracy and
dispassion. Those with the skill will show it, and those without will not feel
humiliated. I let them interview me, and if that means they want me to go up to
the whiteboard and struggle through a merge sort, so be it. In this way, I push
back against the interview culture that normalizes degradation and humiliation.</p>

<p>If you are interviewing others, take a serious look at your practices. Would a
failed candidate feel humiliated and disrespected? What will they tell their
coworkers and friends at meetups about your company? Will they talk about
feeling respected, and how they hope to get the chance to work with you one day?
Or will they talk of a group of self-righteous jerks who abuse their power to
make others feel small? You can break the cycle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are considering using F#, you might be curious how to handle unit test
mocking, especially if you want to use both modules and classes. In a language
like C# or Java, the common method is to a DI container or handmade constructor
injection on a class. These &ldquo;entry points&rdquo; allow for a unit test to replace a
real dependency with a test-only replacement.</p>

<p>I previously posted an example that shows a much simpler way to inject
dependencies called the <a href="http://deliberate-software.com/simplemock-unit-test-mocking/">SimpleMock pattern</a>. The SimpleMock pattern can also be
used in F#, even if you are only using modules.</p>

<h2>SimpleMock in F# Modules</h2>

<p>We will assume you are mocking inside a module and not a class. Mocking inside
an F# class would look much the same as it does in C#, which we showed in the
SimpleMock post. Here is a sample program that does some work and persists the
results.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">sum</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>To apply the SimpleMock pattern, we can use argument currying by adding a simple
function wrapper.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>We started by renaming the <code>addAndSave</code> function with a trailing <code>'</code>. We
created a new <code>addAndSave</code> that calls <code>addAndSave'</code> with the correct
dependency for the first argument, leaving the rest of the arguments to be
called later. Currying is what allows this ability. The new <code>addAndSave</code>
function only needs the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> parameters. At test time, we called <code>addAndSave'</code>, passing in the needed dependency, but using a lambda as the
&ldquo;fake&rdquo;. The injection is as close to the dependency use as possible!</p>

<p>The earlier replacement for DBModule.saveSum is a bit complex, and it does not
show us how many times the fake was called. We can easily make a helper that
takes parameters and returns them when called, along withe count of times it was
called.</p>

<p>The above code might be hard to comprehend at first! We have made a generic
helper that can create any single argument fake we need. We return a tuple,
containing the fake lambda and an instance of <code>TestFakeResults</code>. The fake
lambda will populate the <code>TestFakeResults</code>, which we can access in the test
via the second arg of the tuple.</p>

<p>We can now re-write the previous test using <code>makeFake_OneArg</code>:</p>

<p>The TestFakeResults can return information about the way it was called,
including the list of all arguments. If we felt we needed the extra
expressiveness, we could also use a mocking library like RhinoMocks or Moq. The
TestFakeResults and its constructor are not essential to the pattern. The most
important part is learning to unit test in F# with confidence.</p>

<h1>Double Bonus: When to Use a Class Instead of a Record</h1>

<p>When I first wrote this post, I used a record instead of a class for the <code>TestFakeResults</code> type. If you have been bitten by the functional programming bug,
you might have wondered at my usage of a mutable class. Here are two alternates
of <code>makeFake_OneArg</code> which use records. You can probably see why I switched to a class:</p>

<p>The only way to use a record is to delay its construction via a lambda which
must be executed by the test code. Both are complex: what we need is a mutable
data structure which we can access via a reference. A record is not that. We can
approximate it using tricks, but ultimately I find both alternatives to be too
complex to justify their use. Sometimes a mutable data structure is the best
choice to solve your problem efficiently. The power of F# is that it gives us
the ability to choose the best tool for the job: records for immutability,
classes for mutability.</p>
