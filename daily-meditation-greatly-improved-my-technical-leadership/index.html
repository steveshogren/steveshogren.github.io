<div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right emailImage" src="/images/meditation.jpg" width="200" title="meditation" alt="meditation"></p>

<p>A couple years ago, a coworker told me a success story about mindful meditation.
He explained how his wife took a class that required an hour of daily meditation
for a whole month. He reported that she found it uncomfortable, but the effects
were astounding. She claimed to feel more relaxed, more focused, and more
&ldquo;herself&rdquo;. She found new reserves of motivation. She dropped the book she&rsquo;d been
trying to write for years, and started a business. After that business failed,
she started another, this time successfully.</p>

<p>Immediately convinced, I started by listening to guided
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness#Mindfulness_meditation">mindfulness meditations</a>
on YouTube and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/science">phone apps</a>. After a couple
weeks of that, I started doing breathing exercises on my own while sitting
listening to rain sounds. I made a habit of doing it for about an hour every day
on my lunch break. A few months later, I hated it.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, after each session I would feel very uncomfortable. I would
be confronted with emotions that made me feel worthless and embarrassed. My mind
was bringing forward all these painful memories and feelings. Over time, I
started to dread the lunch break.</p>

<h2>The Revelation</h2>

<p>Then, one day, I had a profound sense of understanding. I realized what was
causing these negative emotions. I was in the middle of a major push to guide
our team to adopt a new programming language. While I&rsquo;d led many such
initiatives before, I saw that I&rsquo;d always had the same struggles. My ego and
self-worth were so tied into &ldquo;my&rdquo; campaigns that I wasn&rsquo;t able to clearly hear
criticism. When people pointed out legitimate concerns or weaknesses, I would
get embarrassed and take it as a personal failure.</p>

<p>I could see, from the very beginning, my current &ldquo;campaign&rdquo; had been poorly
executed. After researching the new technology for a long time, I felt like I
saw a place where it could solve some of our needs. Instead of carefully writing
out a proposal, I &ldquo;half-jokingly&rdquo; brought it up whenever I could. When the
listeners didn&rsquo;t immediately react positively, I quickly retracted the idea,
&ldquo;just kidding&rdquo;. Over weeks I dropped not-so-subtle hints, &ldquo;this would be better
with&hellip;&rdquo;, or, &ldquo;we wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem if&hellip;&rdquo;. Instead of convincing
anyone of anything, I just broadcasted to everyone how insecure I felt about the
issue. Everyone could clearly see that I cared, but I was too afraid to put
myself out there and make a serious suggestion. For months nothing changed, and
I felt more and more bitter that &ldquo;my idea&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t being listened to. In reality,
I hadn&rsquo;t even made a serious suggestion yet!</p>

<p>Eventually, the people around me started to listen and research the new
language. They agreed it really did solve a need we had. After a while, enough
people got on board that we started using it more. Even then, I held tightly to
&ldquo;my idea&rdquo;, afraid that it would prove to be a failure. When someone ran into
issues, I would get defensive. Even though I tried to keep my emotions in check,
I clearly took any criticism of the language as if it was a personal failing, no
matter how legitimate. I&rsquo;d tightly coupled my ego to my ideas, and I always had.</p>

<p>After a few months of meditating, this idea rocked my world. My negative
emotions came from a realization that my actions were not in line with my
values. I don&rsquo;t want my self-worth to be tied to a simple tool. No tool is worth
it. Every tool fails. I&rsquo;d sold myself short, lowered my self-worth to that of a
tool. This completely blocked my ability to be an effective technical leader.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t hear criticism of my ideas without getting defensive, so I couldn&rsquo;t
think critically. I couldn&rsquo;t help work out solutions to the best of my ability,
because that would mean admitting personal failure. Every side comment or
momentary struggle felt like a catastrophe.</p>

<p>After realizing this, I felt a wave of relief. My emotional struggle leading
this programming language change made sense! And I had an easy way out! I simply
had to distance myself from my ideas, separate my self-worth from my tools. The
more I meditated, the easier it got.</p>

<h2>Present Day</h2>

<p>While I still sometimes get the old pang of embarrassment or defensiveness, now
I understand where it comes from, and how to move forward. I can let my ideas
go. I can consider ideas critically. I can make changes and adjustments if the
ideas are not working.</p>

<p>This summer I decided to write up my learning. I wanted to always be able to
look back and remember these important lessons. My write-up was the seed for the
book <a href="https://leanpub.com/convincingcoworkers">Convincing Coworkers</a>. I explain
the lessons learned from implementing a half dozen major technical changes, and
how I learned to lead without letting my ego cloud my thinking.</p>

<p>If you want to become a more effective leader, I highly recommend a practice of
daily meditation. Meditation gives your mind a chance to deeply consider your
actions and values. It allows your subconscious to reflect on what and why you
act.</p>

<p>Not everyone will struggle from the same issues as me. Every leader has a
different set of challenges and situations. Meditation lets your mind analyze
your unique weaknesses and strengths, coming up with a tailored perspective.
Meditating allows your mind to creatively look for ways to improve itself. While
rarely comfortable, this process can have incredible benefits.</p>

<h2>Appendix: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with the connotations of meditation&rdquo;</h2>

<p>You may feel uncomfortable with meditation because of its current strong
associations with religion. Meditation is not inherently religious. I consider
meditation like an exercise routine for the mind. If you are religious, and
exercise your body as a form of religious expression, exercise is a religious
practice. If you are not religious, and you exercise to improve your health and
well-being, exercise is a secular practice. Meditation is just a form of mental
exercise. Simple as that.</p>

<p>Meditation is a tool, and the tool wielder determines its use. Don&rsquo;t let a fear
of the connotations of meditation stop you from experiencing improved
leadership, creativity, and focus!</p>
