<div class="entry-content"><p>
  Can we agree for this post that money, energy, time, and effort are
  all forms of power? Like literally, if I wanted to build a building,
  I am going to need tools, skills, materials, labor. I can use the
  most liquid form of power I have (cash) to acquire all these things,
  or I can use a much less liquid form of power (my time) to harvest,
  extract, refine, learn, and build my building myself. Usually,
  economies of scale mean it is dramatically more efficient for me to
  specialize in one way of converting time into liquid power. Then,
  when I need something, I simply pass that money on to someone else
  who is also a specialist.
</p>
<p>
  Now you know why I don&#8217;t quarry my own stone to build an
  amphitheater in my back yard.
</p>
<p>
  When you work a job, you are converting one form of power you have:
  time (and usually skills), into another much more liquid form of
  power: money. One can extend the model to include calories and
  shelter (the power to sleep safely) along with time and skills.
  Great, this is just basic economics, right? You need power (money)
  to buy power (food and shelter) to buy power (time) to convert back
  into more power (money). Since you are &#8220;harvesting&#8221; something finite
  and therefore scarce (time out of your short life), if you are
  disciplined and lucky, you can consistently end up with a net
  positive.
</p>
<p>
  On to the point! I read a post today mentioning
  the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx">&#8220;5:01 developer&#8221;</a>. It made me mad.
</p>
<p>
  Ideas like this are so subtle they just seep into your psyche. I
  don&#8217;t think anyone would say under normal conditions, &#8220;I should
  really work for free today&#8221;. But, effectively, that is what this
  whole phrase is about. The phrase lets people who cram eight hours
  of work into ten hours &#8220;get back&#8221; at those that get the same work
  done in six to eight. To clarify, this title is not about &#8220;saving
  the company&#8221; or &#8220;giving back to society&#8221;; those are unusual
  conditions. No, it is a chastisement of developers who do not &#8220;give
  back to the company&#8221;. Sort of a tax, for the privilege of getting
  paid to work there, you should, according to this ideal, just give
  back some of that power they gave you. Thinking about this with the
  power model, you should accept money to work there in exchange for
  your time, but, when the time comes, you should deliberately
  short-change yourself by giving them extra time. Like some sort of
  weird tip.
</p>
<p>
  Hopefully this sounds as ridiculous as it really is.
</p>
<p>
  Now, in that post, the author sort of backpedals a little bit,
  saying that <i>what he really meant</i> was a developer who stops
  thinking about development as soon as work is over: someone not
  passionate. The issue I have is the whole wording of that phrase
  assumes a passion for their <i>job</i>, not a passion for
  their <i>craft</i>.
</p>
<p>
  I do not think it makes sense to demand every person
  be <i>passionate</i> about the job they are doing. There have been
  many times I have (even at a job I normally loved) done long,
  boring, and fruitless work. I did not do that work out of my passion
  for the &#8220;Mission: Save the World of Enterprise Banking&#8221;, but because
  I am a professional: I do what needs to be done to the best of my
  abilities.
</p>
<p>
  I think professionalism is very important. In others I work with, I
  want to see the attitude that causes someone to stay abreast in
  their field. I want to be around those who keep their own saws
  sharp, who come in and work hard, and who push themselves and those
  around them to be best they can.
</p>
<p>
  Back to overtime: in my experience, very few offices care enough
  about their developers to let them sharpen their saws at work, so
  why would you waste your precious free time there? Will they pay you
  more for it? Doubtful. Will they be less likely to fire you when
  times get tough? <i>Maybe</i>. Sounds to me like a lot of
  speculation. A lot of investment for a marginal or non-existent
  return. If you want more money: either ask for a raise, go take a
  raise at a new job, or work a second job on the side. Those have a
  direct impact on your income. Putting in extra hours hoping someone
  will notice and reward you for it makes about as much sense as
  assuming you will get a raise for wearing the boss&#8217;s favorite color
  every day.
</p>
<p>
  Consider the person who stays one extra hour a day as an
  &#8220;investment&#8221;. The typical end of the year raise scale I have seen in
  the US in companies larger than 30 people is a 0-5% increase a
  year. Uncommonly does someone get more than that, and should not be
  considered a usual practice. The typical best you can expect is
  5%, maybe a bonus (in four diverse jobs, none gave bonuses, so I
  haven&#8217;t considered them personally). Back to the extra hour a day. Not
  completely out there, not putting in a vast amount extra, right?
  Well, one extra hour is 12.5% percent more hours a day. But the most
  you can expect, on average, is 5%, if you are lucky! To put it in
  perspective, I have seen guys put in 12 hour days and get fired
  because the boss didn&#8217;t get along with them.
</p>
<p>
  At a <i>few</i> points in my career, I worked longer hours. Once it
  was because I truly enjoyed the work and it was fun. Another time it
  was because I felt like the extra time was going to directly pay off
  as an investment (it didn&#8217;t). A few times I have stuck around to
  &#8220;wrap this off&#8221; or &#8220;help out with something deeply unusual that has
  to be done outside normal work hours&#8221;. I recently recommended to my
  little brother he work longer hours, as he was hired without many
  needed skills and on shaky footing with the boss. He worked out a
  deal where he spent two extra hours a day for a couple months
  reading and practicing to get &#8220;caught up&#8221;. His boss got to see his
  hustle when he was the first one in and last one out every day; he
  got to study away from the distractions of everyday life. <b>In all
  circumstances, make overtime the exception, never the rule.</b>
</p>
<p>
  One last point. Before you think me a selfish jerk about my free
  time, know that I make it a daily habit to spend 30-60 minutes
  outside work advancing my development skills. I practice interactive
  rebases, work through awesome books, do online courses, advance side
  projects, contribute to open source, give local meetup talks, and
  learn new languages. These are the basics of what I feel is
  necessary to sustain and advance myself as a professional. If I
  simply worked a 45-50 hour work week instead, I personally would not
  have the motivation to <i>afterwards</i> stay so abreast of
  important changes in the development world. I would become much less
  effective over time, never getting any better. When the need for new
  paradigms or technologies arose, I would be so stuck in a rut that
  fear and ignorance would drive all my decisions.
</p>
<p>
  Treat overtime like an investment, and make it wisely. You are
  literally mining your life for time, so make sure you are
  comfortable with your investment strategies.
