<div class="entry-content"><p>
  Can we agree for this post that money, energy, time, and effort are
  all forms of power? Like literally, if I wanted to build a building,
  I am going to need tools, skills, materials, labor. I can use the
  most liquid form of power I have (cash) to acquire all these things,
  or I can use a much less liquid form of power (my time) to harvest,
  extract, refine, learn, and build my building myself. Usually,
  economies of scale mean it is dramatically more efficient for me to
  specialize in one way of converting time into liquid power. Then,
  when I need something, I simply pass that power on to someone else
  who also specializes and therefore produces at a much more efficient
  rate whatever it is I need.
</p>
<p>
  Now you know why I don&#8217;t quarry my own stone to build an
  amphitheater in my back yard.
</p>
<p>
  When you work a job, you are converting one form of power you have:
  time (and usually skills), into another much more liquid form of
  power: money. One can extend the model to include the calories and
  shelter (the power to sleep safely) along with that time and skills.
  Great, this is just basic economics, right? You need power (money)
  to buy power (food and shelter) to buy power (time) to convert back
  into more power (money). Since you are &#8220;harvesting&#8221; something finite
  and therefore scarce (time out of your short life), if you are
  disciplined and lucky, you can consistently end up with a net
  positive.
</p>
<p>
  On to the point! I read a post today mentioning
  the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx">
  &#8220;5:01 developer&#8221;</a>. It made me mad.
</p>
<p>
  Ideas like this are so subtle they just seep into your psyche. I
  don&#8217;t think anyone would say under normal conditions, &#8220;I should
  really work for free today&#8221;. But, effectively, that is what this
  whole phrase is about. The phrase lets people who cram eight hours
  of work into ten hours &#8220;get back&#8221; at those that get the same work
  done in six to eight. To clarify, this title is not about &#8220;saving
  the company&#8221; or &#8220;giving back to society&#8221;, those are unusual
  conditions. No, it is a chastisement of developers who do not &#8220;give
  back to the company&#8221;. Sort of a tax, for the privilege of getting
  paid to work there, you should, according to this ideal, just give
  back some of that power they gave you. Thinking about this with the
  power model, you should accept money to work there in exchange for
  your time, but, when the time comes, you should deliberately
  short-change yourself by giving them extra time like some sort of
  tip.
</p>
<p>
  Hopefully this sounds as ridiculous as it really is.
</p>
<p>
  Now, in that post, the author sort of backpedals a little bit,
  saying that <i>what he really meant</i> was a developer who stops
  thinking about development as soon as work is over, someone not
  passionate. The issue I have is the whole wording of that phrase
  assumes a passion for their job, not a passion for their craft.
</p>
<p>
  I do not think it makes sense to demand every person
  be <i>passionate</i> about the job they are doing. There have been
  many times I have had to (even at a job I normally loved) do long,
  boring, and fruitless work. I did not do them out of my passion for
  the &#8220;Mission to Save the World of Enterprise Banking&#8221;, but because I
  am a professional who does what needs to be done and who does it to
  the best of my abilities.
</p>
<p>
  What I do think is important is professionalism. I want to see the
  attitude that causes someone to stay abreast of their field, keep
  their own saws sharp (and help teach/inspire others to do
  the same), come in and work hard, and push themselves and those
  around them to be better.
</p>
<p>
  Back to overtime: in my experience, very few offices care enough
  about their developers to let them sharpen their saws at work, so,
  why would you waste your precious free time there? Will they pay you
  more for it? Doubtful. Will they be less likely to fire you when
  times get tough? <i>Maybe</i>. Sounds to me like a lot of
  speculation. A lot of investment for a marginal or non-existent
  return. If you want more money: either ask for a raise, go take a
  raise at a new job, or work a second job on the side. Those have a
  direct impact on your income, putting in a ton of extra hours hoping
  someone will notice and reward you for it makes about as much sense
  as assuming you will get a raise for wearing the bosses favorite
  color every day.
</p>
<p>
  Consider the person who stays one extra hour a day as an
  &#8220;investment&#8221;. The typical end of the year raise scale I have seen in
  the US is a 0-5% increase a year. Uncommonly does someone get more
  than that, and should not be considered a usual practice. So the
  typical best you can expect is 5%, maybe a bonus (in four diverse
  jobs, none gave bonuses, so I haven&#8217;t considered them). Back to the
  extra hour a day. Not completely out there, not putting in a vast
  amount extra, right? Well, one extra hour is 12.5% percent more
  hours a day. But the most you can expect on average is 5%, if you
  are lucky! To put it in perspective, I have seen guys put in 12 hour
  days and get fired because the boss didn&#8217;t get along with them.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, I have yet to personally get less than a 9%
  increase by moving to another job, and one was 60% (yep, in the same
  region, but it was a different tech stack). Not only do they come
  with a raise, but by moving to different development stacks, teams,
  domains, industries, etc, I have been able to enhance my skills
  exponentially faster than if I had never left my first job. Those
  enhanced skills are then like a feedback loop into future
  &#8220;offer-raises&#8221;. Perhaps one day more companies will realize how
  extremely foolish it is to only offer large &#8220;raises&#8221; to developers
  you have never even worked with, and instead start giving larger
  raises to their best people to keep them around. A smart company
  would realize that their best 20% are probably doing 80% of the
  beneficial work, and as a rule should never be able to find a job
  offer that pays more than staying and getting a yearly raise.
  Instead, most companies compensate their best with raises barely
  over inflation, and to even get those the worker must spend a
  portion of their time navigating complicated hoop mechanisms which
  are usually subjective anyway (I, as the boss, saw a few isolated
  events that make me <i>feel</i> like you really grew technically
  this year, 4 out 5 in that category!). These same companies so
  stingy with raises are usually willing to dish out much larger sums
  to completely unproven developers from other companies, with whom
  they have only gone on a handful of &#8220;interview-speed-dates&#8221;.

</p>
<p>
  At a <i>few</i> points in my career, I worked longer hours. Once it
  was because I truly enjoyed the work and it was fun. Another time
  it was because I felt like the extra time was going to directly pay
  off as an investment (it didn&#8217;t). A few times I have stuck around to
  &#8220;wrap this off&#8221; or &#8220;help out with something deeply unusual that has
  to be done outside normal work hours&#8221;. I recently recommended to my
  little brother he work longer hours, as he was hired without many
  needed skills and on shaky footing with the boss. He worked out a
  deal where he spent two extra hours a day for a couple months
  reading and practicing to get &#8220;caught up&#8221;. His boss got to see his
  hustle when he was the first one in and last one out every day; he
  got to study away from the distractions of life. <b>In all
  circumstances, overtime is the exception, never the rule.</b>
</p>
<p>
  One last point. Before you think me a churlish jerk about
  development, I make it a daily habit these days to spend 5-10 hours
  a week outside work advancing my skills. I practice interactive
  rebases, work through awesome books, do online courses, advance side
  projects, contribute to open source, give local meetup talks, and
  learn new languages. These are the basics of what I feel is
  necessary to advance myself as a professional. If I simply worked a
  45-50 hour work week, I personally would not have the motivation
  to <i>afterwards</i> stay so abreast of important changes in the
  development world. I would be much less effective, never getting any
  better. When the need for new paradigms or technologies would come,
  I would be so stuck in a rut that fear would drive my decision.
