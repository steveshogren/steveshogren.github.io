  <div class="entry-content">I was at the Clojadelphia meetup on Thursday, and got an excellent run through of the tools.trace library from Tim Visher. He has submitted a pull request to the original authors, with his expanded and very clear documentation found <a title="here" href="https://github.com/timvisher/what-does-tools-trace-do/blob/master/src/what_does_tools_trace_do/core.clj">here</a>.

One call from the library in particular really stood out, a call for finding out what form threw an exception out of many.

Which is incredibly cool. At the time, I could see using that all the time for helpful benefits. In the last few days though, I realized a more obvious function has been far more helpful to my daily development: deftrace. Deftrace just replaces a defn, and does the same, but it also prints out the ins and outs of the function.

At this point in the demo, the room was leaping out of their chairs laughing in sheer delight at how awesome this is. It is ultimately such a simple idea, and yet it's execution is brilliant and inconceivably handy.
<br />
<br />
At first, I thought, "well that is an incredibly cool party trick, but a party trick nonetheless". A few days of regular clojure development later, I realized the profundity of this library.
<br />
<br />
I have had on my list of "pain points" an item to learn how to debug clojure code. Once in a while, I have felt the need to find out exactly what was going on at a certain point, and had to awkwardly put in (do (pprint x) x) statements everywhere. Clearly though, that is lame.
<br />
<br />
Here is the grand reveal. <strong>Concepts and tools that other languages have sometimes look very different in clojure.</strong> "Well, duh", you say. I am not talking about syntax! I am talking about the <em>tools.</em>
<br />
<br />
I wanted a debugger (and, yes, I know at least traditional one exists for clojure), and so that is what I would have looked for: the traditional "put in a breakpoint, run the code, pause at that place, inspect values, etc". When I first saw tools.trace, the image of a "debugger replacement" did not immediately enter my head. But, tools.trace basically gives me almost all the benefit of a traditional debugger at effectively no hassle or cost. Just now I was developing some code, and got stuck on a spot where something unexpected happened, and with only a second's hassle, replaced a few defns with deftrace. I re-ran my code in the repl, and now got a printout of exactly what the in's and out's were, and all of a sudden it clicked. "I just found my new debugger", and, "wow, this debugger is way less hassle".
<br />
<br />
No, of course this doesn't do everything a full debugger does, but at least for the foreseeable future, it probably will do enough most of the time. The first time I need a real full debugger, I will go looking for it, but for now, I suspect this gets me my 80% benefit for way less than 20% hassle.
<br />
<br />
The discovery of such tools is what is making learning clojure such a profoundly rewarding journey for me. I am being taught to think about the "default ide" tools in such a different light. Watching as community members distill out these sort of High-Value concentrate tools using Clojure's meta-programming is simply the most mind altering thing I have experienced in programming.

  <div class="entry-content"><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, it’s far more efficient to leave certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debts</a> unpaid.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m not saying we should leave messes, instead I am saying that cleaning and fixing technical debt is so important we must prioritize the most important changes first, by highest value to the team. You don't just do whatever feature is next alphabetically do you? Nope, so neither should you do that with refactorings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not all technical debts are created equal: they consist of varying amounts of interest as well as principal. We still don’t have a way to accurately count the cost of technical debt. Fortunately, a little effort goes a long way toward estimating the its “payoff price”. Much like paying off a real debt, paying the highest-interest debts first makes the most sense.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ll give you a real life example of some technical debt repayments. Last month at my work, we all agreed that all our namespaces, project names, and assembly names were woefully out of date. The naming confusion hadn't cost us a lot of time, but, like an annoying paper cut, we felt the pain whenever we looked at it. The system had outgrown the single small product it once was, and the names had not grown with it. A few project names did not even match up with their folders, causing extra disorientation every time anyone read them. We all voted to make updating all that cruft our “dev chore” of the week. Unfortunately, we did not weigh the relative cost versus the value of that cleanup to the team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Three weeks later, we were still neck-deep in cleanup. The renaming process caused many subtle bugs because of a variety of unconsidered issues. Our work ground to a halt as we put all hands on deck to finish the task and fix all the bugs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We hadn’t considered the terms on that technical debt. The principal was high: paying it cost weeks of nonstop effort. What about the interest? At best, it was tiny, fractions of a percent of the time it took to pay it off. How long will it take us to make that time back? Five years? Ten?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now consider another common refactoring: renaming a private function. What does it cost to fix a badly named local function? Practically nothing, just a few keystrokes. What does it cost to leave it undone? You have to look at that bad function definition each time you work in that file. Leaving the technical debt would cost more than paying it down. Why wouldn’t you immediately pay down such a debt?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Clearly, this is not an exact science, but our refactorings will take on a very critical dimension when we add interest to the technical debt metaphor. I now evaluate any refactoring effort that would take longer than a few minutes in this mindset, thinking critically about what I do and why. I keep my big technical debt chores in a list prioritized by interest (regardless of the principal), so there is never any doubt what my next task should be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">As time goes on, developers will be all the harder pressed to keep up with the skyrocketing number of languages and frameworks. The number of javascript libraries alone is increasing at a furious pace: Angular, Backbone, Node, Ember, Knockout, Knockback, Meteor, etc, etc, etc. Who has a chance at keeping up? While having so many options is also beneficial, it makes it more and more challenging for a single developer to stay relevant.
<br />
<br />
You are a good programmer. No, you are a great programmer. But, you are stuck in one development stack. You want to diversify your knowledge, experience, and skill set, but your resume reads like a one-act play. Chances are, you didn't deliberately choose to work in this stack. At the start of your career, the first job you landed was probably the best you could find. Several years have gone by, and you are beginning to realize that the development world is moving on.
<br />
<br />
Maybe you have already tried, having gone to a few interviews. Nevertheless, you’re still as stuck as when you started, because many of the cool shops are still figuring out how to do good hiring in this new, fast-changing paradigm. They want developers who already have experience in their stack, but they haven't realized that filtering for previous experience is only one heuristic for finding good talent. So, what are your options?
<br />
<br />
Here is how to escape from your language. Like all the best advice, it is simple, yet profound. It consists of the following three steps:
<br />
<br />
1. Pick a new stack.<br />
 2. Learn it.<br />
 3. Build a network.
<br />
<br />
Picking a stack is not an easy thing to do, but I have good news for you: once you master these steps, you won't ever be stuck again. No matter which one you pick, when the time comes, you will be able to quickly move way ahead of the pack. Don’t worry about trying to pick the one that will last your whole career, since, (and this may come as a shock to you) it probably won't last you a decade! That's why we should love software development, for the fast pace! If you want a job that never changes, go be a <del>librarian</del> <del>doctor</del> <del>lawyer</del> gardener.
<br />
<br />
Which language should you pick? You have two big categories to choose from that I suggest:
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">The popular</li>
	<li dir="ltr">The exotic</li>
</ul>
<br />
The popular languages have significantly more, and a greater variety of jobs. On the down side, you also have more competition from other developers, and most of them have been using that language since before they were born. To stand out here, you need something to differentiate yourself from the other candidates: a unique perspective, skill in another programming paradigm, an ability to quickly learn new things, rapidly change contexts, etc. Figure out what your unique contributions are, and communicate them clearly.
<br />
<br />
Alternatively, on the exotic route, you pick an up-and-coming language, the new hotness, as it were. Because it is so new, there are much fewer jobs in this language, and less long-term stability. Consequently, there are also much fewer experienced developers. Savvy companies using this language will hire interested developers, despite them lacking any experience with it. (All your hard work in step two will really pay off here.)
<br />
<br />
Having chosen a language, now it’s time to learn it! Fill your github with work in that language.
 Read some books on it. Look for ways to use it at your current job. If your situation allows, start a big side project in it. You don't HAVE to open-source the code on github, but this certainly helps to publicize your learning. Companies seek prior job experience to avoid having to pay to train you; well then, beat them to the punch by already knowing it!
<br />
<br />
To build your network, go to meetups and get involved in them. I cannot emphasize this enough.
 Stick out your hand and introduce yourself. Make connections with the people you meet. Learn about the tools people use at their work. You will begin to think like a developer in that stack as you’re exposed to new concepts. Soon enough, you will develop a sense of what companies are hiring and who would give you a recommendation at their company.
<br />
<br />
Mind your attitude when interviewing. Resist the urge to cynically compare and contrast the old and new stacks. I have interviewed too many candidates who could not stop talking about how great their old language is, or how “these new hipster languages are just a fad”. While you are certainly always entitled to your opinion, (who knows, you may even be right!), carrying on like this in an interview setting never leaves a good impression.
<br />
<br />
Perhaps you’re thinking that this is just too much effort. Just like everything in life, choosing not to move is also a valid move. I like to call it "riding into the sunset". In this option, you never leave your language, ever. Though this may feel like the safer choice right now, it carries its own risks. If you hate maintenance projects, you need to learn to love them, because they are going to be your bread and butter. But, you will be competing for these projects with all the other sunsetters, and there are going to be a lot of them. From what I have heard, however, once you have reached the point where there are more maintenance jobs than there are remaining developers, you really do get to write your own ticket, but this can take decades. My great uncle did this, and he managed to stay employed in COBOL till he retired.
<br />
<br />
While escaping from your stack requires effort, by following the steps you can achieve it in just a few hours a week. So, get out there and do it!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing I strongly recommend to developers when starting at a new job is to keep a list of everything that bothers you.</p>

<p>For every new company you work at, there will always be a set of things that you see as pain points, because you came from a place that did those things differently.</p>

<p>Notice I said differently, not better.</p>

<p>All of us have certain irrational attachments to the various things we are used to doing: things we do not because it’s the best way to do them, but because it’s become comfortable to do them that way. I have seen new developers come onto a team and complain endlessly about something that is clearly a net benefit for them and the team. However, the team is so used to doing it their way that they cannot imagine changing.</p>

<p>Allow me to share a personally painful example.</p>

<p>Much to my regret, when I moved into .NET development coming from the scripting world, I complained non-stop about how annoying it was to have to assign a type to everything.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I didn’t realize how strong typing enabled very powerful tooling, and to be perfectly honest, I probably didn’t care. However, I did realize that my complaints were falling on deaf ears. My co-workers, who had never even looked at a dynamically typed language before, didn’t care. Much worse, I was alienating myself from them, becoming<em> that guy</em>, the one who just complains all the time. I sucked.</p>

<p>So, I decided on a new policy. Whenever something offended my sensibilities, seeming worse, wrong or just different, I would document it in a to-do list (I use <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> in emacs, because it’s mind-alteringly cool). I would stop complaining about it, stop making sidelong hints at it. I would just add it to the list. Apparently, I was pretty opinionated about how to make that team better, because that list grew monstrously large in just a few months.</p>

<p>Next, I would review that list every week. Whenever I had downtime I would pick something small and try to implement whatever I needed to make that work, things like:  like installing a CI server, or figuring out how to unit test this crazy actionscript fla.</p>

<p>If an issue was too large or I lacked the understanding to resolve all at once, I would do root cause analysis and brainstorm different ways to achieve the goal. Sometimes, I would take something off the list, either because it was too costly to justify its value, or because sometimes I realized I was grossly incorrect in my understanding of the issue.</p>

<p>So, back to my example about static typing. After about a year, I realized there was no way I could reasonably argue it was worth a change. No one but me cared, no one was interested in<a href="http://deliberate-software.com/how-to-escape-from-programming_language/" target="_blank"> learning new languages to try to use for development</a>, and the cost to convert anyway would have been staggering (and conversion was likely impossible).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I learned that while static typing is a cost of doing business in some languages, statically-typed languages lead the modern pack for powerful refactoring tooling (at least ‘til Yegge’s team finishes their quest for the Holy Grail (the <a href="https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4vQtz">Grok Project</a>; search that post for grok. And I said modern tools, so no smalltalk flame!)). My arguments advocating a change basically fell into two categories:: “I like it better”, and, “you won’t miss those refactoring and intellisense tools much”. You can imagine my co-workers’ reaction to either category: *Sad trombone*. Good thing I was keeping them all to myself in my to-do list.</p>

<p>This process, this simple change, powerfully changed my behavior and attitude. I am convinced that it helped me to mature, both socially and as a developer. No longer was I the whiny developer looking to his team lead to “kiss his boo-boos”, I was learning to weigh cost/benefits of both my short- and long-term goals for that team.</p>

<p>I also discovered a serendipitous side-effect from my todo-list. After about a year and a half when all the pain points had grown calloused, I was able to look back over my list for outstanding reminders of points of our process, still needing refinement. It was a way for me to reconnect with my <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?BeginnersMind">beginners mind</a>, and it was very helpful.</p>

<p>Since I started this process have I been able to participate in many discussions about an idea, article, or pain point another developer had mentioned where I have already thought through my position, because it is either something I have already noticed and have been working on a solution for, or I have been researching it, or I concluded (from my limited perspective) it wasn’t worth the effort.</p>

<p>Not many people reflect this deeply or have their thoughts so organized on important subjects affecting their work. It would make a powerful impression were you to find yourself involved in a hallway discussion with your boss about training, and you could nonchalantly add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><p>“Oh, new hire training. Yes, I have been considering how we train new hires for a long time, and I have a few ideas here on what would help our particular needs.”</p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, a few times something I had previously concluded wasn’t worth the effort due to internal political reasons suddenly has become possible, and I have been able to lead the group in that new endeavor, having spent effort considering and concluding how to best implement it.</p>

<p>When you find yourself complaining about the pain of a new job, don’t be a whiner. Don’t try to bully the other developers into doing things according to your “obviously better” way. Write your pain points down and start planning how you can truly impact your team for the best.</p>
