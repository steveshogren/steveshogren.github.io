  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to make a model that predicts bugs.</p>

<p>I previously wrote a table for scoring language safety:
<a href="http://deliberate-software.com/programming-language-safety-algorithm/">Programming Language Safety Score</a>,
but it was extremely time consuming to score new languages or make modifications.</p>

<h2>Simplify, Simplify</h2>

<p>After being told I was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">overfitting</a>
the data, I&rsquo;ve attempted to clean up by simply checking if each category is
enforced, possible, or impossible. I score each as either 1 (language enforced),
0 (possible, but you have to remember to do it), or -1 (impossible). When the
magnitudes of the new model are compared with the previous model, they come out
very similar. The shape of the curve pretty much stays the same, which I was
told indicates that the character count weighting was a variable that didn&rsquo;t
matter.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rplot.jpg" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<p>The code I used to generate the plot and normalize the scores can be found here:
<a href="https://github.com/steveshogren/datasciencecoursera/blob/817dec79e36b6e9a6c5a8fd5700aff7cc394b9d4/scoreplot.R">scorePlot.R</a></p>

<h2>Safety Definitions</h2>

<p>A definition of the safety checks is as follows:</p>

<p><div ng-app="TableApp2">
<div ng-controller="TableCtrl">
<table class="langtable">
<tr><th>Check</th> <th>Description</th></tr>
<tr ng-repeat="check in langChecks">
<td> {{ check.name }} </td>
<td>  {{ check.desc }}  </td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>The new scores are shown here, with a lot more languages added in:</p>

<p><p class="lead">
<div style="overflow-x:scroll">
<table class="langtable">
<tr>
<th>Safety Check</th>
<th></th>
<th>
<select ng-options="getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="languages[0]"></select>
</th>
<th>
<select ng-options="getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="languages[1]"></select>
</th>
<th>
<select ng-options="getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="languages[2]"></select>
</th>
<th>
<select ng-options="getName(lang) for lang in allLanguages" ng-model="languages[3]"></select>
</th>
</tr>
<tr ng-repeat="check in langChecks" score-row name="check.name" row-key="check.key"></tr>
<tr class="totals"><td>Totals</td>
<td></td>
<td ng-repeat="lang in langTotals track by $index">
 {{ lang }}
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="totals"><td>Magnitude</td>
<td></td>
<td ng-repeat="lang in langTotals track by $index">
 {{ percentageTotals(lang) }}%
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div></p>

<p>Current Languages:
<span ng-repeat="lang in allLanguages">
 {{ getName(lang) }}: {{ allLangTotals[$index] }},
</select></p>

<h2>So, What&rsquo;s the Point?</h2>

<p>To see how this model corresponds with data in the real world, I used the GitHub
API to query for the number of bugs created in repositories with more than 15
forks created in a span from 2011 to 2015. Commits were counted by summing the
commit counts of all contributors.</p>

<p>I decided to rely on the count of commits as a standard for a unit of work. My
assumption was that across fifty different projects, the commit sizes would
average out. Once the unit of work was decided on, I wanted to find the ratio of
bugs per commit for each language.</p>

<p>I collected the ratio of bugs logged per commit for each repository, and after
grouping by primary language, removed the top and bottom 25% using the
bug/commit ratio, which is a common practice in statistics to help find a more
accurate average. I summed the bugs and commits of those remaining repositories
grouped by language, finding a total average bug/commit ratio for each language
grouping. Here is that data, sorted by safety score.</p>

<p><table class="langtable">
<tr><th>Language</th>
<th>Bugs</th>
<th>Commits</th>
<th>Repositories</th>
<th>Bug/Commits</th>
<tr ng-repeat="lang in languageRatios">
<td> {{ lang.name }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.bugs }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.commits }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.repos }} </td>
<td> {{ getBugsRatio(lang) }} </td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>Here are the languages sorted by safety score with bug/commit ratios:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/errorChart.jpg" title="image" alt="images">
<img class="center" src="/images/bugsAverage.jpg" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<p>I took the magnitude of the safety scores and the bug/commit ratios. After
inverting the safety scores, I overlaid them both onto a single graph.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/bothMags.jpg" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<p>Immediately it is obvious that Ruby, Python, PHP, and Clojure all seem to strongly
buck the trend, but otherwise the languages follow a pretty consistent slope
down in bugs. Taking the correlation gives a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient">correlation coefficient</a>
of .55</p>

<h2>What About Unit Tests?</h2>

<p>Thinking that Ruby, Clojure, PHP, and Python might not correlate well due to some
other factor, I collected data on how many tests each repository had. I counted
the number of files containing &ldquo;test&rdquo; or &ldquo;spec&rdquo;, which gave the following,
sorted by tests per commit:</p>

<p><table class="langtable">
<tr><th>Language</th>
<th>Tests</th>
<th>Commits</th>
<th>Repositories</th>
<th>Tests/Commits</th></tr>
<tr ng-repeat="lang in sorter(languageRatios)">
<td> {{ lang.name }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.test }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.commits }} </td>
<td> {{ lang.repos }} </td>
<td> {{ getTestsRatio(lang) }} </td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>PHP, Python, and Ruby all have a higher then average number of tests, but
Clojure does not. Additionally, Go, Scala, and Java all also have a higher than
average number of tests, yet they score relatively average in bugs/commit.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, the current safety model I have proposed seems to account for a
moderate reduction in bugs per commit across the sampled languages, but is not
the only factor. It currently is unable to account for a significantly lower
than expected bug count in Ruby and Clojure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&rsquo;s play a thought exercise. Imagine your development toolchain is like a
semantic version number. Small features that incrementally improve your
situation are like minor updates. They don&rsquo;t cause any large shifts in thinking
or process. Major updates are big, new concepts, quantum jumps in theory or
practice.</p>

<p>I am not talking about the political, social, or financial aspects of a
toolchain. For example, hiring is a complex beast entirely in its own
category. The criteria for choosing a tool when hiring a few hundred offshore
developers is very different than the criteria for hiring for a team of three
senior developers. I&rsquo;ll leave those aspects alone.</p>

<p>What are some examples of these value changes I&rsquo;ve noticed in my development?</p>

<h2>Minor Benefits</h2>

<h3>Perl - PHP - Python - Ruby</h3>

<p>Switching from Perl to PHP for me was a minor change. I was able to carry over
almost all my skills, and for the most part, the differences were mostly
syntactic. Later, when I started using Python, most of my experience from Perl
and PHP was still useful. The libraries had different names, and a few concepts
were different, but on the whole, all three were in a same class of productivity
for me.</p>

<p>More recently, on taking over a small Ruby codebase (scripts, not Rails), I again
found much of my previous experience was still valuable. I can almost guess what
things will be called or how they should be used. I still have to look up
library names and keywords, but on the whole, the languages all provide very
similar workflows. I suspect all four are in the same class of productivity,
with some minor differences here and there. These days I put effort only into
maintaining familiarity with one of these languages, since I am confident I
could quickly relearn any of the other three on demand.</p>

<h3>Java - VB.NET - CSharp</h3>

<p>Moving between Java, VB.NET, and C# feel similarly minor in tangible
productivity. For the most part, all the expectations and experience carries
between the three. Obviously the tools are different, and there are a number of
gotchas, but nothing changed my productivity in any major way. I doubt any of
those three have any one killer feature that cannot be had in the other.</p>

<h2>Major Benefits</h2>

<h3>Automated Testing</h3>

<p>Switching from &ldquo;run it and see&rdquo; testing to automated unit and integration
testing was a major change with large productivity benefits. All my experience
to date was still useful, but I needed a whole new set of skills to be able to
apply the techniques. Tools like dependency injection, mocking, TDD, and
continuous integration enabled me to build and revive much larger
systems. Automated testing is a skill that applies well to every language I&rsquo;ve
worked in, with benefits that grow increasingly valuable with more complex
systems. I don&rsquo;t always automated test, but it is an invaluable tool for certain
classes of problems.</p>

<h3>REPL Development (moving from Python/Ruby to Clojure)</h3>

<p>Repl based development with live hot patching was another major change. It
required a new way of thinking about programming, and with it came an
instantaneous feedback loop. Much like unit testing, it was an entirely new
skill, but opened up a very fast method of building up a system from small
parts. Additionally, it allowed me to rapidly progress in my skills, because I
could instantly see live feedback from my code, without needing to write a whole
test just to execute the code.</p>

<h3>Powerful Static Typing (moving from C# to F#)</h3>

<p>Moving from a typical static typed language to one with algebraic data types has
been a major change, with major productivity benefits. I have noticed entire
classes of defects disappearing. Additionally, because of the better compiler
errors, the resulting codebases are much easier to refactor, which means a
faster reaction to a changing domain.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Several times in the last week people have lamented to me that they &ldquo;just don&rsquo;t
get Lisp&rdquo;. After hearing it for the third time, I thought back to my experience
learning a Lisp.</p>

<p>When I set out to learn a Lisp, I expected it would be easy.</p>

<p>I figured, &ldquo;I am pretty awesome at PHP, and have worked professionally in Perl,
Python, and Java, this should be a cakewalk!&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d read Paul Graham&rsquo;s essays on
how Lisp is his secret weapon, and figured I needed to get into this secret
weapon stuff. My ego said, &ldquo;since Paul is amazing, and I am too, I&rsquo;ll be a
natural!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I expected to tinker around with &ldquo;Lisp&rdquo; (I didn&rsquo;t know there was more
than one) and shortly master it to be able to ship a website with it.</p>

<p>What happened instead took me a little longer&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>05/11 - 06/11 - ~15 Hrs Attempted <em>Land Of Lisp</em> (gave up)</li>
<li>04/12 - 08/12 - ~60 Hrs Rewrote a PHP side project in Clojure</li>
<li>08/12 - 08/12 - ~5 Hrs Attempted <em>Let Over Lambda</em> (gave up)</li>
<li>08/12 - 09/12 - ~10 Hrs Read <em>Clojure Programming</em> twice</li>
<li>09/12 - 12/12 - ~30 Hrs Took <em>CS173 Programming Languages</em> online at Brown University</li>
<li>05/13 - 07/13 - ~50 Hrs Worked through <em>Let Over Lambda</em></li>
<li>05/13 - 07/14 - ~250 Hrs Worked through <em>SICP</em></li>
<li>07/14 - Shipped production Clojure code</li>
</ul>


<p>This shows only the major events: books and large projects, but doesn&rsquo;t show all
the countless blogs, tutorials, and tiny projects that also filled in the gaps.</p>

<p>I think Lisps started to &ldquo;click&rdquo; for me around mid 2013, about two years after
deciding that I&rsquo;d &ldquo;tinker around&rdquo; for a bit before &ldquo;mastering&rdquo; it. I was
approximately 170 hours in at that point. The book that finally made it all
click was <em>Let Over Lambda</em>, but it took me two attempts and almost a year of
pre-learning to be able to understand enough to internalize the material.</p>

<p>All said and done, I spent approximately 420 hours between Common Lisp, Racket,
Typed Racket, and Clojure before I felt confident enough to suggest shipping
Clojure at work. I don&rsquo;t claim to be a fast learner at all, and I fully expect
some people will snort with derision at how much time it took me - which is kind
of the point of this post.</p>

<p>This timeline should show those who are struggling that what you are feeling is
normal. Learning anything new is hard. The more &ldquo;new&rdquo; it is, the harder it will
be. Clojure, macros, emacs, and a repl workflow are all very different from
everything I was used to and significantly more powerful than I would&rsquo;ve
guessed. It took a long time for that to become normal, and for that power to
sink in and become a tool I anticipated having.</p>

<p>If you are struggling and feel like a failure, understand <em>there is no wrong
way</em>. It might take you a long time of repeated exposure before the alien
tooling starts to look familiar, and then comfortable. Maybe that book you are
struggling with actually IS too advanced, so find an easier one, and circle back
to the harder book later. Maybe, like me, you need some part of many different
books, tutorials, side projects, and katas.</p>

<p>If you are struggling learning and in the Philly area, I am happy to meet up to
chat. I am also happy to help over the wire as well. I understand how
demoralizing the constant battle is to learn something new, especially when it
feels like your ego is on the line and the whole internet is pressuring you to
learn new things. Don&rsquo;t give up, it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>

<h1>Was it worth it?</h1>

<p>I can anticipate the follow up question: &ldquo;was it worth it?&rdquo; Absolutely yes. I
now feel a fluid comfort with my current professional stack (C#, F#, Clojure,
and JS) that previously I did not have. I am significantly more productive at
programming, regardless of the language. Work that was previously challenging is
now trivial, and work that was previously &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; now feels fun and
challenging. Was it learning Lisp specifically that caused all those changes?
Probably not, but I believe it was learning something far outside my normal
comfort zone that made the difference. I think I would have had equivalent
experiences had I invested that time learning Scala (the ML parts), Haskell,
Idris, J, R, Forth, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Learning new tools, technologies, and methodologies is
hard. Counter-intuitively, the most exhausting part is <em>after</em> you&rsquo;ve gained a
good comprehension of the tool, and now, filled with excitement, you try to
explain it to someone else.</p>

<p>They almost always react with hostility.</p>

<p>What is going on? You just took time to learn this exciting tool that could save
everyone a lot of time, and not only do they not care, but they resent you for
it!  Don&rsquo;t they see how this could be great for everyone?</p>

<p>The issue, like humans, is complex and dynamic. Maybe they feel like you&rsquo;ve now
made them look lazy in comparison. Maybe they have tried other tools in the past
only to discover they weren&rsquo;t as a good as promised. Maybe they are afraid they
won&rsquo;t be able to learn the new tool as quickly as they need to, and will be left
behind. Maybe they are afraid all the time they spent learning the existing
tools will have been wasted. Maybe they are comfortable where they are, and
don&rsquo;t care about increased productivity. Maybe they are tired of learning new
things.</p>

<p>Most times I have seen this, I think the root emotion is fear. Fear of failure,
of change, of being embarrassed, of looking inferior. Fear is a powerful
emotion.</p>

<p>When you respond with further hostility, this only will compound their
fear. Should they put their comfort and ego before the needs of the business?
No, but your counterattack will only further prove to them that their fear was
deserved.</p>

<p>The final hardest part of learning a new tool is when you are forced to use an
inferior tool. Suddenly that liberating fresh air of power is replaced with a
suffocating claustrophobia of weakness. Even if the tool isn&rsquo;t really that
inferior, it now <em>feels</em> terrible. It becomes worse when you and many others
around you agree with the better value proposition of a new tool, and yet you
are still required to use the inferior tool due to someone in power blocking you
for political reasons.</p>

<p>For the developer who sets out to learn new things, you must learn to deal with
inferior tools. Once you start learning, you will always find yourself in a
situation where you are required to use an inferior tool. For me, this has been
one of the hardest things to face in my career.</p>
