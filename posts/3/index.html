  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&rsquo;s play a thought exercise. Imagine your development toolchain is like a
semantic version number. Small features that incrementally improve your
situation are like minor updates. They don&rsquo;t cause any large shifts in thinking
or process. Major updates are big, new concepts, quantum jumps in theory or
practice.</p>

<p>I am not talking about the political, social, or financial aspects of a
toolchain. For example, hiring is a complex beast entirely in its own
category. The criteria for choosing a tool when hiring a few hundred offshore
developers is very different than the criteria for hiring for a team of three
senior developers. I&rsquo;ll leave those aspects alone.</p>

<p>What are some examples of these value changes I&rsquo;ve noticed in my development?</p>

<h2>Minor Benefits</h2>

<h3>Perl - PHP - Python - Ruby</h3>

<p>Switching from Perl to PHP for me was a minor change. I was able to carry over
almost all my skills, and for the most part, the differences were mostly
syntactic. Later, when I started using Python, most of my experience from Perl
and PHP was still useful. The libraries had different names, and a few concepts
were different, but on the whole, all three were in a same class of productivity
for me.</p>

<p>More recently, on taking over a small Ruby codebase (scripts, not Rails), I again
found much of my previous experience was still valuable. I can almost guess what
things will be called or how they should be used. I still have to look up
library names and keywords, but on the whole, the languages all provide very
similar workflows. I suspect all four are in the same class of productivity,
with some minor differences here and there. These days I put effort only into
maintaining familiarity with one of these languages, since I am confident I
could quickly relearn any of the other three on demand.</p>

<h3>Java - VB.NET - CSharp</h3>

<p>Moving between Java, VB.NET, and C# feel similarly minor in tangible
productivity. For the most part, all the expectations and experience carries
between the three. Obviously the tools are different, and there are a number of
gotchas, but nothing changed my productivity in any major way. I doubt any of
those three have any one killer feature that cannot be had in the other.</p>

<h2>Major Benefits</h2>

<h3>Automated Testing</h3>

<p>Switching from &ldquo;run it and see&rdquo; testing to automated unit and integration
testing was a major change with large productivity benefits. All my experience
to date was still useful, but I needed a whole new set of skills to be able to
apply the techniques. Tools like dependency injection, mocking, TDD, and
continuous integration enabled me to build and revive much larger
systems. Automated testing is a skill that applies well to every language I&rsquo;ve
worked in, with benefits that grow increasingly valuable with more complex
systems. I don&rsquo;t always automated test, but it is an invaluable tool for certain
classes of problems.</p>

<h3>REPL Development (moving from Python/Ruby to Clojure)</h3>

<p>Repl based development with live hot patching was another major change. It
required a new way of thinking about programming, and with it came an
instantaneous feedback loop. Much like unit testing, it was an entirely new
skill, but opened up a very fast method of building up a system from small
parts. Additionally, it allowed me to rapidly progress in my skills, because I
could instantly see live feedback from my code, without needing to write a whole
test just to execute the code.</p>

<h3>Powerful Static Typing (moving from C# to F#)</h3>

<p>Moving from a typical static typed language to one with algebraic data types has
been a major change, with major productivity benefits. I have noticed entire
classes of defects disappearing. Additionally, because of the better compiler
errors, the resulting codebases are much easier to refactor, which means a
faster reaction to a changing domain.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Several times in the last week people have lamented to me that they &ldquo;just don&rsquo;t
get Lisp&rdquo;. After hearing it for the third time, I thought back to my experience
learning a Lisp.</p>

<p>When I set out to learn a Lisp, I expected it would be easy.</p>

<p>I figured, &ldquo;I am pretty awesome at PHP, and have worked professionally in Perl,
Python, and Java, this should be a cakewalk!&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d read Paul Graham&rsquo;s essays on
how Lisp is his secret weapon, and figured I needed to get into this secret
weapon stuff. My ego said, &ldquo;since Paul is amazing, and I am too, I&rsquo;ll be a
natural!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I expected to tinker around with &ldquo;Lisp&rdquo; (I didn&rsquo;t know there was more
than one) and shortly master it to be able to ship a website with it.</p>

<p>What happened instead took me a little longer&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>05/11 - 06/11 - ~15 Hrs Attempted <em>Land Of Lisp</em> (gave up)</li>
<li>04/12 - 08/12 - ~60 Hrs Rewrote a PHP side project in Clojure</li>
<li>08/12 - 08/12 - ~5 Hrs Attempted <em>Let Over Lambda</em> (gave up)</li>
<li>08/12 - 09/12 - ~10 Hrs Read <em>Clojure Programming</em> twice</li>
<li>09/12 - 12/12 - ~30 Hrs Took <em>CS173 Programming Languages</em> online at Brown University</li>
<li>05/13 - 07/13 - ~50 Hrs Worked through <em>Let Over Lambda</em></li>
<li>05/13 - 07/14 - ~250 Hrs Worked through <em>SICP</em></li>
<li>07/14 - Shipped production Clojure code</li>
</ul>


<p>This shows only the major events: books and large projects, but doesn&rsquo;t show all
the countless blogs, tutorials, and tiny projects that also filled in the gaps.</p>

<p>I think Lisps started to &ldquo;click&rdquo; for me around mid 2013, about two years after
deciding that I&rsquo;d &ldquo;tinker around&rdquo; for a bit before &ldquo;mastering&rdquo; it. I was
approximately 170 hours in at that point. The book that finally made it all
click was <em>Let Over Lambda</em>, but it took me two attempts and almost a year of
pre-learning to be able to understand enough to internalize the material.</p>

<p>All said and done, I spent approximately 420 hours between Common Lisp, Racket,
Typed Racket, and Clojure before I felt confident enough to suggest shipping
Clojure at work. I don&rsquo;t claim to be a fast learner at all, and I fully expect
some people will snort with derision at how much time it took me - which is kind
of the point of this post.</p>

<p>This timeline should show those who are struggling that what you are feeling is
normal. Learning anything new is hard. The more &ldquo;new&rdquo; it is, the harder it will
be. Clojure, macros, emacs, and a repl workflow are all very different from
everything I was used to and significantly more powerful than I would&rsquo;ve
guessed. It took a long time for that to become normal, and for that power to
sink in and become a tool I anticipated having.</p>

<p>If you are struggling and feel like a failure, understand <em>there is no wrong
way</em>. It might take you a long time of repeated exposure before the alien
tooling starts to look familiar, and then comfortable. Maybe that book you are
struggling with actually IS too advanced, so find an easier one, and circle back
to the harder book later. Maybe, like me, you need some part of many different
books, tutorials, side projects, and katas.</p>

<p>If you are struggling learning and in the Philly area, I am happy to meet up to
chat. I am also happy to help over the wire as well. I understand how
demoralizing the constant battle is to learn something new, especially when it
feels like your ego is on the line and the whole internet is pressuring you to
learn new things. Don&rsquo;t give up, it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>

<h1>Was it worth it?</h1>

<p>I can anticipate the follow up question: &ldquo;was it worth it?&rdquo; Absolutely yes. I
now feel a fluid comfort with my current professional stack (C#, F#, Clojure,
and JS) that previously I did not have. I am significantly more productive at
programming, regardless of the language. Work that was previously challenging is
now trivial, and work that was previously &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; now feels fun and
challenging. Was it learning Lisp specifically that caused all those changes?
Probably not, but I believe it was learning something far outside my normal
comfort zone that made the difference. I think I would have had equivalent
experiences had I invested that time learning Scala (the ML parts), Haskell,
Idris, J, R, Forth, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Learning new tools, technologies, and methodologies is
hard. Counter-intuitively, the most exhausting part is <em>after</em> you&rsquo;ve gained a
good comprehension of the tool, and now, filled with excitement, you try to
explain it to someone else.</p>

<p>They almost always react with hostility.</p>

<p>What is going on? You just took time to learn this exciting tool that could save
everyone a lot of time, and not only do they not care, but they resent you for
it!  Don&rsquo;t they see how this could be great for everyone?</p>

<p>The issue, like humans, is complex and dynamic. Maybe they feel like you&rsquo;ve now
made them look lazy in comparison. Maybe they have tried other tools in the past
only to discover they weren&rsquo;t as a good as promised. Maybe they are afraid they
won&rsquo;t be able to learn the new tool as quickly as they need to, and will be left
behind. Maybe they are afraid all the time they spent learning the existing
tools will have been wasted. Maybe they are comfortable where they are, and
don&rsquo;t care about increased productivity. Maybe they are tired of learning new
things.</p>

<p>Most times I have seen this, I think the root emotion is fear. Fear of failure,
of change, of being embarrassed, of looking inferior. Fear is a powerful
emotion.</p>

<p>When you respond with further hostility, this only will compound their
fear. Should they put their comfort and ego before the needs of the business?
No, but your counterattack will only further prove to them that their fear was
deserved.</p>

<p>The final hardest part of learning a new tool is when you are forced to use an
inferior tool. Suddenly that liberating fresh air of power is replaced with a
suffocating claustrophobia of weakness. Even if the tool isn&rsquo;t really that
inferior, it now <em>feels</em> terrible. It becomes worse when you and many others
around you agree with the better value proposition of a new tool, and yet you
are still required to use the inferior tool due to someone in power blocking you
for political reasons.</p>

<p>For the developer who sets out to learn new things, you must learn to deal with
inferior tools. Once you start learning, you will always find yourself in a
situation where you are required to use an inferior tool. For me, this has been
one of the hardest things to face in my career.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Domain modeling in F# is significantly easier and safer than with the
traditional .NET languages. This is because of the increased safety of
pattern matching and the expressiveness of discriminated unions. These
concepts are not in C# or VB.NET, and therefore bring a new tool to
the table.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, I found some old code I&rsquo;d written to interact with
a legacy system. The system uses many single enums on a record to keep
track of statuses. When one changes, it can cause others to change as
well.</p>

<p>Here is a typical function that combines two enums to recalculate a
third.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With some regularity, new records are added to these types of enums,
causing a dangerous search and update across the system fixing all the
if/else or switch/case statements.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, pattern matching is a huge win here, taking a hard
to comprehend function and making the domain concepts clear.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If we add a new status to any of these, we will get a compiler warning
in every place letting us know. If that alone was the win, we&rsquo;d be
still be ahead by a lot. The domain is so clear here, I can print this
code out and hand it to my BA to ensure the logic is correct.</p>

<p>Next though, this got me thinking. Why does this set of three enums
have to be calculated? Why are they even separate? Ah, of course,
right now they are stored in the database and ORM objects, each with a
separate field and set of enum ids. Changing that would be costly.</p>

<p>What I want is a domain layer a level higher than the typical database
ORM classes, something to convert my ORM classes into that will be
able to do work in a safer way.</p>

<p>Rather than three enums that are supposed to change in lock step (but
might get out of date), I really want a concept of the three combined
and &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; together.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now I have a combined Direction that merges the three concepts into
one. It is impossible with this new merged type to have an invalid
state across the three. Getting any of the types back out to convert
into the ORM classes or do some work is as simple as another match:</p>

<p>While it is possible to make an equivalent C# enum and combine these
in a similar way, it is inherently unsafe (nothing to guarantee you
covered every case) and therefore appropriately uncommon. The typical
answer for safe polymorphic dispatch in C# is to use an interface and
classes. Unfortunately, something still has to dispatch on that enum
id, either inside a class or at the time of class instantiation. That
is a vector for errors.</p>

<p>Because F# interops so well with C#, it is possible to build in a
domain layer in F# immediately that calls down to your C# ORM
classes. Converting from a set of dangerous C# enums into a
constrained and safe F# discriminated union is easy and will simplify
your domain to its essence.</p>

<p>For reasons like this, when I have to build something with a rich
domain, I reach for F#.</p>
