  <div class="entry-content"><p>Several times in the last week people have lamented to me that they &ldquo;just don&rsquo;t
get Lisp&rdquo;. After hearing it for the third time, I thought back to my experience
learning a Lisp.</p>

<p>When I set out to learn a Lisp, I expected it would be easy.</p>

<p>I figured, &ldquo;I am pretty awesome at PHP, and have worked professionally in Perl,
Python, and Java, this should be a cakewalk!&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d read Paul Graham&rsquo;s essays on
how Lisp is his secret weapon, and figured I needed to get into this secret
weapon stuff. My ego said, &ldquo;since Paul is amazing, and I am too, I&rsquo;ll be a
natural!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I expected to tinker around with &ldquo;Lisp&rdquo; (I didn&rsquo;t know there was more
than one) and shortly master it to be able to ship a website with it.</p>

<p>What happened instead took me a little longer&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>05/11 - 06/11 - ~15 Hrs Attempted <em>Land Of Lisp</em> (gave up)</li>
<li>04/12 - 08/12 - ~60 Hrs Rewrote a PHP side project in Clojure</li>
<li>08/12 - 08/12 - ~5 Hrs Attempted <em>Let Over Lambda</em> (gave up)</li>
<li>08/12 - 09/12 - ~10 Hrs Read <em>Clojure Programming</em> twice</li>
<li>09/12 - 12/12 - ~30 Hrs Took <em>CS173 Programming Languages</em> online at Brown University</li>
<li>05/13 - 07/13 - ~50 Hrs Worked through <em>Let Over Lambda</em></li>
<li>05/13 - 07/14 - ~250 Hrs Worked through <em>SICP</em></li>
<li>07/14 - Shipped production Clojure code</li>
</ul>


<p>This shows only the major events: books and large projects, but doesn&rsquo;t show all
the countless blogs, tutorials, and tiny projects that also filled in the gaps.</p>

<p>I think Lisps started to &ldquo;click&rdquo; for me around mid 2013, about two years after
deciding that I&rsquo;d &ldquo;tinker around&rdquo; for a bit before &ldquo;mastering&rdquo; it. I was
approximately 170 hours in at that point. The book that finally made it all
click was <em>Let Over Lambda</em>, but it took me two attempts and almost a year of
pre-learning to be able to understand enough to internalize the material.</p>

<p>All said and done, I spent approximately 420 hours between Common Lisp, Racket,
Typed Racket, and Clojure before I felt confident enough to suggest shipping
Clojure at work. I don&rsquo;t claim to be a fast learner at all, and I fully expect
some people will snort with derision at how much time it took me - which is kind
of the point of this post.</p>

<p>This timeline should show those who are struggling that what you are feeling is
normal. Learning anything new is hard. The more &ldquo;new&rdquo; it is, the harder it will
be. Clojure, macros, emacs, and a repl workflow are all very different from
everything I was used to and significantly more powerful than I would&rsquo;ve
guessed. It took a long time for that to become normal, and for that power to
sink in and become a tool I anticipated having.</p>

<p>If you are struggling and feel like a failure, understand <em>there is no wrong
way</em>. It might take you a long time of repeated exposure before the alien
tooling starts to look familiar, and then comfortable. Maybe that book you are
struggling with actually IS too advanced, so find an easier one, and circle back
to the harder book later. Maybe, like me, you need some part of many different
books, tutorials, side projects, and katas.</p>

<p>If you are struggling learning and in the Philly area, I am happy to meet up to
chat. I am also happy to help over the wire as well. I understand how
demoralizing the constant battle is to learn something new, especially when it
feels like your ego is on the line and the whole internet is pressuring you to
learn new things. Don&rsquo;t give up, it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>

<h1>Was it worth it?</h1>

<p>I can anticipate the follow up question: &ldquo;was it worth it?&rdquo; Absolutely yes. I
now feel a fluid comfort with my current professional stack (C#, F#, Clojure,
and JS) that previously I did not have. I am significantly more productive at
programming, regardless of the language. Work that was previously challenging is
now trivial, and work that was previously &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; now feels fun and
challenging. Was it learning Lisp specifically that caused all those changes?
Probably not, but I believe it was learning something far outside my normal
comfort zone that made the difference. I think I would have had equivalent
experiences had I invested that time learning Scala (the ML parts), Haskell,
Idris, J, R, Forth, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Learning new tools, technologies, and methodologies is
hard. Counter-intuitively, the most exhausting part is <em>after</em> you&rsquo;ve gained a
good comprehension of the tool, and now, filled with excitement, you try to
explain it to someone else.</p>

<p>They almost always react with hostility.</p>

<p>What is going on? You just took time to learn this exciting tool that could save
everyone a lot of time, and not only do they not care, but they resent you for
it!  Don&rsquo;t they see how this could be great for everyone?</p>

<p>The issue, like humans, is complex and dynamic. Maybe they feel like you&rsquo;ve now
made them look lazy in comparison. Maybe they have tried other tools in the past
only to discover they weren&rsquo;t as a good as promised. Maybe they are afraid they
won&rsquo;t be able to learn the new tool as quickly as they need to, and will be left
behind. Maybe they are afraid all the time they spent learning the existing
tools will have been wasted. Maybe they are comfortable where they are, and
don&rsquo;t care about increased productivity. Maybe they are tired of learning new
things.</p>

<p>Most times I have seen this, I think the root emotion is fear. Fear of failure,
of change, of being embarrassed, of looking inferior. Fear is a powerful
emotion.</p>

<p>When you respond with further hostility, this only will compound their
fear. Should they put their comfort and ego before the needs of the business?
No, but your counterattack will only further prove to them that their fear was
deserved.</p>

<p>The final hardest part of learning a new tool is when you are forced to use an
inferior tool. Suddenly that liberating fresh air of power is replaced with a
suffocating claustrophobia of weakness. Even if the tool isn&rsquo;t really that
inferior, it now <em>feels</em> terrible. It becomes worse when you and many others
around you agree with the better value proposition of a new tool, and yet you
are still required to use the inferior tool due to someone in power blocking you
for political reasons.</p>

<p>For the developer who sets out to learn new things, you must learn to deal with
inferior tools. Once you start learning, you will always find yourself in a
situation where you are required to use an inferior tool. For me, this has been
one of the hardest things to face in my career.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Domain modeling in F# is significantly easier and safer than with the
traditional .NET languages. This is because of the increased safety of
pattern matching and the expressiveness of discriminated unions. These
concepts are not in C# or VB.NET, and therefore bring a new tool to
the table.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, I found some old code I&rsquo;d written to interact with
a legacy system. The system uses many single enums on a record to keep
track of statuses. When one changes, it can cause others to change as
well.</p>

<p>Here is a typical function that combines two enums to recalculate a
third.</p>

<p>With some regularity, new records are added to these types of enums,
causing a dangerous search and update across the system fixing all the
if/else or switch/case statements.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, pattern matching is a huge win here, taking a hard
to comprehend function and making the domain concepts clear.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If we add a new status to any of these, we will get a compiler warning
in every place letting us know. If that alone was the win, we&rsquo;d be
still be ahead by a lot. The domain is so clear here, I can print this
code out and hand it to my BA to ensure the logic is correct.</p>

<p>Next though, this got me thinking. Why does this set of three enums
have to be calculated? Why are they even separate? Ah, of course,
right now they are stored in the database and ORM objects, each with a
separate field and set of enum ids. Changing that would be costly.</p>

<p>What I want is a domain layer a level higher than the typical database
ORM classes, something to convert my ORM classes into that will be
able to do work in a safer way.</p>

<p>Rather than three enums that are supposed to change in lock step (but
might get out of date), I really want a concept of the three combined
and &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; together.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now I have a combined Direction that merges the three concepts into
one. It is impossible with this new merged type to have an invalid
state across the three. Getting any of the types back out to convert
into the ORM classes or do some work is as simple as another match:</p>

<p>While it is possible to make an equivalent C# enum and combine these
in a similar way, it is inherently unsafe (nothing to guarantee you
covered every case) and therefore appropriately uncommon. The typical
answer for safe polymorphic dispatch in C# is to use an interface and
classes. Unfortunately, something still has to dispatch on that enum
id, either inside a class or at the time of class instantiation. That
is a vector for errors.</p>

<p>Because F# interops so well with C#, it is possible to build in a
domain layer in F# immediately that calls down to your C# ORM
classes. Converting from a set of dangerous C# enums into a
constrained and safe F# discriminated union is easy and will simplify
your domain to its essence.</p>

<p>For reasons like this, when I have to build something with a rich
domain, I reach for F#.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think the time has come for a standard programming language safety

safety is much more nuanced than a binary bit of &ldquo;has strong-static

thoughts of unit tests, long build times, and red squiggles in an
IDE. But, in day-to-day development, there are so many times when we
are bitten by things that somehow just slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>I put together this scoring model to get a sense of how safe a
language is at the primitive level, and if it isn&rsquo;t safe by default,
how much it costs to manually make it safe. Since all abstractions
eventually result in a series of primitive operations, I decided that
focusing only on primitives would still be a valuable (if incomplete)
data point. While any good library will handle all primitive checks
and present the consumer with a well-designed abstraction, in the end,
the consumer is still left wiring libraries together, building their
own primitive abstractions for integration. Due to the impossibility of
measuring the quality of abstractions in all libraries for a language,
I left that entirely out of scope of this model, unless it is designed
as a primitive check.</p>

<p>By focusing on only primitive operations: making and calling
functions, naming data, working with sequences, and dealing with
language primitive data types, I slimmed down the large range of
possible error vectors to a small handful. While in some languages it
is common to use user-defined classes to wrap around a set of
primitives, those classes are still doing the same primitive work,
just hidden behind a user-created abstraction. The more ways it is
possible to make a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; with a primitive, the more difficult it
is to build such good abstractions.</p>

<pre><code>This model is not about language "power".
</code></pre>

<p>This model is not about ranking the &ldquo;power&rdquo;, &ldquo;expressiveness&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;abstract-ability&rdquo; of a language. In any language that supports
abstractions (functions, classes, modules, naming data), I am
convinced, given enough code, all Turing complete langauges can do the
same work. This model is only about the costs to prevent unexpected
&ldquo;confusion&rdquo; between the programmer and the machine at the primitive
level.</p>

<p>Rather than focus on what is <em>possible</em> with a language, I will
instead focus on what is typically idiomatic to that community. For
example, if it is possible to achieve a level of safety in a language
but by doing something uncommon, that should not be counted.</p>

<p>To score a language, simply figure out how many characters it costs to
&ldquo;prevent&rdquo; a certain type of error, and add that to the
total. Newlines, spaces, and tabs do not count, but all other
punctuation does. If a specific check is language enforced, like F#&rsquo;s
Option or C#&rsquo;s parameter type enforcement, that is given a -30 (by
default) to make up for the lack of unit tests and code exercising
needed to run that &ldquo;path&rdquo;. Do not count import lines for libraries, as
importing the module will have a negligible effect on the code size
and complexity.</p>

<p>If there is a safety feature that is not possible to achieve
programmatically, we will add +30 (by default) for a &ldquo;every change run
and debug to fix&rdquo; cost, such as Java not having a way to prevent stack
overflow exceptions caused by recursion.</p>

<pre><code>A lower score is "safer", needing less (or no) code to achieve the same level of safety.
</code></pre>

<p>Rather than tell you my thoughts (or survey for) hard-coded
weightings, all checks are weighted the same by default. Feel free to
apply your own weightings, to better match to your or your team&rsquo;s
specific needs and preferences. The languages are masked by default to
protect the innocent. You can unmask the names and see the code used
below the table.</p>

<p>I want to see your language represented here! I&rsquo;ll happily take pull
requests for new languages: <a href="https://github.com/steveshogren/blog-source/blob/master/source/javascripts/sliders.js">blog source</a>. Just
use the &ldquo;edit language&rdquo; and &ldquo;copy to clipboard&rdquo; to build your own
language data structure.</p>

<p>I would love to see every major language represented, including major
language &ldquo;idiom communities&rdquo;. For example, Clojure and Typed Clojure
are vastly different in abilities. Similarly &ldquo;Scala - The Better Java&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Scala - The JVM Haskell&rdquo; have vastly different idioms with
apparently very separate communities.</p>

<p><div ng-show="showRealName"> Feel free to put in your own examples by
playing with the samples below. Code surrounded with &lt;! !> is ignored
from the tally, since it would vary heavily based on the language and
desired result. Variable and type names are kept at single characters,
which are counted. Feel free to add in your own language below, and
use the copy feature to extract the data structure to use in a pull
request.</p>
