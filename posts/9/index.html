  <div class="entry-content"><p>December 1st, I made myself a New Year's resolution to completely create an Android game that I would not be ashamed to show people from (mostly) scratch before the end of December. What made it the most fun was that I started with practically no experience with the Android platform at all, and so I got to pick it up by the seat of my pants.<p />The biggest challenge was probably the last three days, where I was faced with some hard calls, when the deadline loomed, and my still mile-long list of wants had to be pruned down just about every few hours. I basically had a "buggy beta" by Wednesday morning, and all the problems remaining were ones I didn't know how to solve or hide, and while all the graphics where there, I could barely stand to look at them. I felt like I was spinning my wheels with no progress. My friend Dan tried to talk me down, pointing out with some clarity that there was no gun to my head, and I was doing this for myself, so I could stop any time. Amusingly enough, that was exactly what I needed to hear. I was doing this for myself, to better myself, to learn more discipline. I wanted to stretch my abilities to the limits. So, I pushed through. I found a book that showed me how to fix my problems, and I didn't stop until every bug I could find was fixed, and everything my poor family pointed out (I made them each play it like a dozen different times) was smoothed.<p />  And last night, after about a hundred hours of total work this month, I slid under the wire with roughly two hours to spare. The game is not in the market YET, because at the end of it all, I concluded I would rather spend the few dozen more hours to convert it to OpenGL ES, and add in a few neat things I was unable to do using the Android canvas, but for a v1, I am immensely proud of the whole experience.<p />I can say, unequivocally; WHEW. <p />This challenge was a fantastic learning experience, and I had several great reminders of what my dad always told me growing up: <strong>just work smarter, son, not harder</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can't get focused today. My mind is a torrent of activity completely unrelated to my task at hand, so I am writing this to get these thoughts out so I can get back to work.<p />I got a call from a recruiter the other day trying to get me to come interview at this job. Right now I am working in VB.NET and Actionscript. Until this job, I was always working in open-source languages: Perl, PHP, and some Java. This is my first real divergence from that pattern, and of course it is in two languages that are, to say the least, not very popular with the open source crowd. This gets me wondering, "what if when I decide to move on, all the fun jobs look down their noses at me for working in unpopular languages?".<p /> To be fair, I still program quite a bit outside work in my favorite languages, and that is all well and good.<p />For some reason though, that recruiter really got under my skin. I keep asking myself questions like, "is spending time right now making a Java game for the Android a good choice long term?" or, "should I spend any more time learning Python with Django, or just get more invested in Javascript and node.js?".<p /> These are not questions I want to be asking myself. <p />So, I sit down to think about it and get it out of my system. What kind of programmer do I want to be in 5 years? I know without a moment's hesitation. <p /> <strong>I want to be the kind of programmer who is not tied to any one language or platform, but is instantly effective and rapidly excellent in </strong><strong><em>every</em> language and platform. </strong><p />Right now, I am learning Common Lisp. Why? To learn better functional programming. Why do I play with Javascript? To be better at client-side web programming. PHP/Python? Server-side web programming. *.NET? Compiled, versioned programming. Android games? For fun! Why do I all this? Because the programmer I want to be is not constrained to his language/platform<em> at all</em>. The programmer I want to be programs at a level <em>over the language</em>.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  In ancient times, plenty of builders did their work without math,
  and I would guess that a good portion of them likely did it faster
  then their math-doing counterparts.
</p>
<p >
  I am certain that when builders first started using math to prove
  that buildings would stand up safely, they were mocked by their
  math-less counterparts. I can hear them now, "Oh, Stephos, it takes
  you 5 times longer to prove your building will stand up, real men
  can just <em>see</em> that it will work". Even in modern times, many
  people build houses and small buildings that probably don't even
  need the math to really "prove" they work, but they perform the due
  diligence anyway. On the other hand, some people today still build
  houses, sheds, tree-houses, lofts, and fire pits without any
  drawings or math at at all, and why should they? They are
  responsible for the risk.
</p>
<p >
  This is all fine, but, builders who shy away from math also don't
  build airliners, space shuttles, and skyscrapers. An aircraft
  designer who doesn't feel like using math to prove their aircraft
  will fly is handed an "Experimental" sticker and gravely patted on
  the back.
</p>
<p >
  Today, programming is at the same place as both
  ancient <strong>and</strong> modern engineering: many projects can
  be done "by eye", and some of the most experienced programmers are
  able to build immense projects alone without any sort of automated
  testing at all. When you go to a forum and ask for help, you are
  just as likely to hear from a "space shuttle" programmer as you are
  to hear from a "tin shack" programmer. The "space shuttle"
  programmer would be horrified to hear of working without automated
  testing and rigorous review practices, whereas the "tin shack"
  programmer would be horrified to think of the time wasted to
  even <em>learn the procedures</em> to automatically prove his code
  works as it should. The "space shuttle" programmer might work on the
  same internal financial project for months or years, finally
  releasing with zero defects; the "tin shack" programmer might churn
  out several quick web sites a day. Neither project
  is <em>better</em> then the other, they both might be perfect for
  what their business needs.
</p>
<p>
  I have heard several times from very good lone wolf programmers that
  testing just slows them down, and in some ways, it does appear to be
  a slowdown for them. Unfortunately, the cost to build even
  medium-sized projects with several workers without automated testing
  is only felt when it is too late, when the deadlines (and costs) are
  spiraling out of control.
</p>
<p>
  The disciplined application of mathematics transformed and
  solidified the field of engineering into a field far more vast and
  capable of some of the most incredible constructions imaginable.
  Would we have smart-phones, GPS, modern cars, and airliners if
  engineering had just avoided mathematics? Just imagine what the
  field of programming could grow into if we continue to learn and
  grow our testing, designing, and writing of software.
</p>
<p>
  I propose that automated testing is to programming what math was
  to ancient engineering.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><br />The last three and a half years for me have been terrible. Why? Well, three and half years ago, I discovered the endless debate, Emacs vs. Vim. Being an efficiency nut, I could not fathom the horror of learning one, and by that action, not learning the other. What if the one I learned was not the "best" one? I could see that both were excellent and worth learning, but I wanted to learn both concurrently. Unfortunately, my body has a hard time learning two completely different keyboard systems at the same time. Heck, three and a half years ago, I was still learning to touch-type. <p /> So, three years pass, and I am now no farther along. <p />Additionally, I read on an almost weekly basis, articles that explain how great Emacs and vim are, you just need to learn one, and learn it well. I wanted to stick with Emacs, for the built-in lisp, and <a href="http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/3996068979/the-levels-of-emacs-proficiency">several</a> of my <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/effective-emacs">favorite</a> programmers highly advocate it. But, I wanted to pick up vim, because it is obviously the far superior text editor, and the default on Linux, and probably will help me not get Emacs <a href="http://xahlee.blogspot.com/2010/06/famous-emacs-people-with-hand-injuries.html">RSI</a> but, perversely, it is not nearly as easy to extend as Emacs. <p /> So, the debate raged in my head for three years, and I stupidly got better at neither. Then, the other day, it clicked. Vim is the greatest text editor of them all, with text objects, highly combine-able commands, and modal editing. Emacs is the greatest IDE of all, with an awesome programming language built-in and thousands of classes and libraries to build on. Vim is built in the tradition of a small, sharp UNIX tool; Emacs in the tradition of HAVING thousands of small sharp tools. <p /> Finally, in a rush, it clicked into place with earth-shattering force: I can make Vim inside Emacs, with lisp, but I really could not remake Emacs inside Vim. <p />Suddenly, in one glorious moment, the world all made sense. Vim, the greatest text editor, should be a part of Emacs, the greatest IDE! My searching had been in vain, there was no way to compare them, they are totally different tools!<p /> In my typical child-like innocence, I rolled up my sleeves, opened up an instance of Emacs, and started making Vim. A few hours later, Google pointed out the obvious: Emacs already has a vi mode built-in (viper). Better yet, with a simple file in the right place, I had <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-es/Vimpulse">vimpulse </a>(the practically complete Vim mode) installed and ready to go. Suddenly, a huge weight lifted off my chest. I am free to use the best tool for the job, and, like Huck Finn, float off down the river, leaving silly feuds behind me. If my actions here seem unnatural, an abomination, an unholy union, I encourage you, leave behind the fan-boyism, pick up your tools, and come build something with men who see their tools for what they truly are: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not a good hill to die on</span>.</p>
