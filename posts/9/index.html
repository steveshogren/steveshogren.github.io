  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  In ancient times, plenty of builders did their work without math,
  and I would guess that a good portion of them likely did it faster
  then their math-doing counterparts.
</p>
<p >
  I am certain that when builders first started using math to prove
  that buildings would stand up safely, they were mocked by their
  math-less counterparts. I can hear them now, "Oh, Stephos, it takes
  you 5 times longer to prove your building will stand up, real men
  can just <em>see</em> that it will work". Even in modern times, many
  people build houses and small buildings that probably don't even
  need the math to really "prove" they work, but they perform the due
  diligence anyway. On the other hand, some people today still build
  houses, sheds, tree-houses, lofts, and fire pits without any
  drawings or math at at all, and why should they? They are
  responsible for the risk.
</p>
<p >
  This is all fine, but, builders who shy away from math also don't
  build airliners, space shuttles, and skyscrapers. An aircraft
  designer who doesn't feel like using math to prove their aircraft
  will fly is handed an "Experimental" sticker and gravely patted on
  the back.
</p>
<p >
  Today, programming is at the same place as both
  ancient <strong>and</strong> modern engineering: many projects can
  be done "by eye", and some of the most experienced programmers are
  able to build immense projects alone without any sort of automated
  testing at all. When you go to a forum and ask for help, you are
  just as likely to hear from a "space shuttle" programmer as you are
  to hear from a "tin shack" programmer. The "space shuttle"
  programmer would be horrified to hear of working without automated
  testing and rigorous review practices, whereas the "tin shack"
  programmer would be horrified to think of the time wasted to
  even <em>learn the procedures</em> to automatically prove his code
  works as it should. The "space shuttle" programmer might work on the
  same internal financial project for months or years, finally
  releasing with zero defects; the "tin shack" programmer might churn
  out several quick web sites a day. Neither project
  is <em>better</em> then the other, they both might be perfect for
  what their business needs.
</p>
<p>
  I have heard several times from very good lone wolf programmers that
  testing just slows them down, and in some ways, it does appear to be
  a slowdown for them. Unfortunately, the cost to build even
  medium-sized projects with several workers without automated testing
  is only felt when it is too late, when the deadlines (and costs) are
  spiraling out of control.
</p>
<p>
  The disciplined application of mathematics transformed and
  solidified the field of engineering into a field far more vast and
  capable of some of the most incredible constructions imaginable.
  Would we have smart-phones, GPS, modern cars, and airliners if
  engineering had just avoided mathematics? Just imagine what the
  field of programming could grow into if we continue to learn and
  grow our testing, designing, and writing of software.
</p>
<p>
  I propose that automated testing is to programming what math was
  to ancient engineering.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><br />The last three and a half years for me have been terrible. Why? Well, three and half years ago, I discovered the endless debate, Emacs vs. Vim. Being an efficiency nut, I could not fathom the horror of learning one, and by that action, not learning the other. What if the one I learned was not the "best" one? I could see that both were excellent and worth learning, but I wanted to learn both concurrently. Unfortunately, my body has a hard time learning two completely different keyboard systems at the same time. Heck, three and a half years ago, I was still learning to touch-type. <p /> So, three years pass, and I am now no farther along. <p />Additionally, I read on an almost weekly basis, articles that explain how great Emacs and vim are, you just need to learn one, and learn it well. I wanted to stick with Emacs, for the built-in lisp, and <a href="http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/3996068979/the-levels-of-emacs-proficiency">several</a> of my <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/effective-emacs">favorite</a> programmers highly advocate it. But, I wanted to pick up vim, because it is obviously the far superior text editor, and the default on Linux, and probably will help me not get Emacs <a href="http://xahlee.blogspot.com/2010/06/famous-emacs-people-with-hand-injuries.html">RSI</a> but, perversely, it is not nearly as easy to extend as Emacs. <p /> So, the debate raged in my head for three years, and I stupidly got better at neither. Then, the other day, it clicked. Vim is the greatest text editor of them all, with text objects, highly combine-able commands, and modal editing. Emacs is the greatest IDE of all, with an awesome programming language built-in and thousands of classes and libraries to build on. Vim is built in the tradition of a small, sharp UNIX tool; Emacs in the tradition of HAVING thousands of small sharp tools. <p /> Finally, in a rush, it clicked into place with earth-shattering force: I can make Vim inside Emacs, with lisp, but I really could not remake Emacs inside Vim. <p />Suddenly, in one glorious moment, the world all made sense. Vim, the greatest text editor, should be a part of Emacs, the greatest IDE! My searching had been in vain, there was no way to compare them, they are totally different tools!<p /> In my typical child-like innocence, I rolled up my sleeves, opened up an instance of Emacs, and started making Vim. A few hours later, Google pointed out the obvious: Emacs already has a vi mode built-in (viper). Better yet, with a simple file in the right place, I had <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-es/Vimpulse">vimpulse </a>(the practically complete Vim mode) installed and ready to go. Suddenly, a huge weight lifted off my chest. I am free to use the best tool for the job, and, like Huck Finn, float off down the river, leaving silly feuds behind me. If my actions here seem unnatural, an abomination, an unholy union, I encourage you, leave behind the fan-boyism, pick up your tools, and come build something with men who see their tools for what they truly are: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not a good hill to die on</span>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  At work last month, I was assigned to fix some bugs in an
  asynchronous legacy code base. My supervisor gave me a month to see
  what I could do, and to see if I could fix a few tricky bugs. The
  code is divided into two sections, a client application and a web
  server. Both the client application and the server have their own
  persistence, and they communicate through a soap web service.
</p>
<p>
  I wanted to try and write some sort of end-to-end tests around this,
  but I could not figure out how to get around that web service. I
  don&#039;t want my tests to rely on a server having to always be up,
  so I initially was planning on writing tests from the client
  database to the web service, where I would just stub some responses.
  I got about an hour into that plan, before I realized I would then
  have to do that same thing on the server, and that sort of testing
  will not really tell me what the code <i>does</i>. I needed to cover
  this whole process end-to-end.
</p>
<p>
 I walked around for a bit, thinking. Then it hit me, both the server
 and client code are written in VB.NET, and, except for the web service, work
 just like plain old highly-coupled code. Hmmm.
</p>
<p>
 For the first pass, I wrote an interface to wrap the web service,
 then used dependency injection to inject a fake web service that (and
 here is the cool part) simply calls around the web service entirely
 to the server code directly and injects a different database
 connection string, so the server talks to a second database I have
 prepared.
</p>
<p>
 Just like that, I can run, all on my machine, 99 percent of the code
 in a single end-to-end test. I can even setup several client
 databases, and rotate them out, to &quot;swap&quot; between several
 clients in the middle of the tests.
</p>
<p>
 I added a few &quot;integration&quot; tests that do talk to a real
 published testing web service, just to make sure everything is still
 in place correctly.
</p>
<p>
  Now, I said this was asynchronous, and it is, the executed
  system-under-test kicks off a thread to talk to the web service, and
  so to get it to test, I needed to wait for the thread to finish,
  then do my assertions.
</p>
<p>
 I used a system where the spun off thread will set a boolean when it
 has finished running, to let the main thread know it has finished,
 and the main thread just keeps checking that boolean until it is
 true. While hackish, that is my current working solution, as no more
 then one thread is ever spun off at a time, I can just have my test
 wait for the thread to finish, then complete the required assertions.

  So, working through the Land of Lisp book, getting the hang of it.
</p>
<p>
Chapter Six, the author starts off by talking a little about
  the Common Lisp REPL, or Read-Eval-Print-Loop that you use as sort
  of the "command line" for interacting with lisp. It is pretty cool,
  you type in code, and it executes. And then he opens the hood a
  little:
</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defun</span> <span class="nv">repl</span> <span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">loop </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">print </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">eval </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">read</span><span class="p">)))))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<p>
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA??!?!?!
</p>
<p>
I just about spit my drink all over the monitor laughing. The
function <strong>eval()</strong> evaluates whatever text is passed in
as code, in this case, from the command line via the obviously
named <strong>read</strong> and after executing
it, <strong>print()</strong> prints the result, and it just does that
forever till you quit.
</p>
<p>
That means, you could make one of these for any language that can
evaluate strings into code. I know python has one built-in. Php can
evaluate code with eval, and a quick search shows a highly nifty (and
robust from the looks of
it) <a href="https://github.com/facebook/phpsh">REPL for php</a>
complements of facebook. Sweet. Or, you can use php -a for the
interactive mode.
