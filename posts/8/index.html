  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately, I have been deliberating on <strong>quality</strong> <strong>vs. speed</strong>. Throughout my career, I have worked with developers who basically consider quality to be a programmer's vice, an extravagance only for the navel-gazing idealists. I have also worked with developers who consider <em>all </em>time spent on quality to be of the utmost importance, and that programming for speed is for those lazy and slapdash realists. I recently read Yegge's post <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html">Done, and Get's Things Smart</a>, and I think I agree with Yegge on this point, that it <em>is</em> possible to perform fast and with high quality, and like a wandering samurai, that is the path I seek. <p />  There are many facets to this, of course, but I have been playing with this mental model. Specifically, my insight here is a new definition of quality: <strong>quality is future speed</strong>. In my mind, quality that is not for future speed <strong>is</strong> an extravagance, something programmers do to entertain themselves, and it is worse than cutting corners in the present, because it sacrifices current work for no future gain. <p />  Lately, my personal projects have taken a certain theme: I want more practice tuning my programming to be as fast as possible <em>both for today and for the future</em>. And to be perfectly honest, usually there is a lot more "future" in most systems than just "today". <p />  So, how have I been doing this? I set arbitrarily short deadlines for myself, so I am forced to practice dropping anything that is not directly related to speed. I then try to rotate projects every month, so I am forced to return to old work, to learn better where I made bad choices that cost me <em>future </em>speed. <p />  Doing this with the right mindset is very humbling, and very insightful. Honestly, this may happen at work accidentally from time to time as well, but rarely at work am I able to carefully reflect on the mistakes of the past. At home, the pain I feel is my own, no one suffers at home other than me, and there is no one to blame but myself. If an architecture is brittle, or the test coverage is low, or the design is resistant to change, (all of which have happened) I am able to take those lessons to heart <em>because I directly caused those problems</em>.<p />  I encourage anyone who, like me, seeks to be a more excellent developer, to give this a try: start a couple of side projects (and don't worry, it took me a year to get the ones I have), and set yourself some crazy tight "delivery dates". Heck, make real products and try to make some money off them, maybe you will be able to get some side-cash! But then, after you have "delivered", take some time to rest, maybe read a book or two, tinker with some other projects, and after a break, return to analyze your past work. Set yourself another strict deadline, try to make a second version, or add some more features. You will find some incredibly valuable lessons there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>December 1st, I made myself a New Year's resolution to completely create an Android game that I would not be ashamed to show people from (mostly) scratch before the end of December. What made it the most fun was that I started with practically no experience with the Android platform at all, and so I got to pick it up by the seat of my pants.<p />The biggest challenge was probably the last three days, where I was faced with some hard calls, when the deadline loomed, and my still mile-long list of wants had to be pruned down just about every few hours. I basically had a "buggy beta" by Wednesday morning, and all the problems remaining were ones I didn't know how to solve or hide, and while all the graphics where there, I could barely stand to look at them. I felt like I was spinning my wheels with no progress. My friend Dan tried to talk me down, pointing out with some clarity that there was no gun to my head, and I was doing this for myself, so I could stop any time. Amusingly enough, that was exactly what I needed to hear. I was doing this for myself, to better myself, to learn more discipline. I wanted to stretch my abilities to the limits. So, I pushed through. I found a book that showed me how to fix my problems, and I didn't stop until every bug I could find was fixed, and everything my poor family pointed out (I made them each play it like a dozen different times) was smoothed.<p />  And last night, after about a hundred hours of total work this month, I slid under the wire with roughly two hours to spare. The game is not in the market YET, because at the end of it all, I concluded I would rather spend the few dozen more hours to convert it to OpenGL ES, and add in a few neat things I was unable to do using the Android canvas, but for a v1, I am immensely proud of the whole experience.<p />I can say, unequivocally; WHEW. <p />This challenge was a fantastic learning experience, and I had several great reminders of what my dad always told me growing up: <strong>just work smarter, son, not harder</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can't get focused today. My mind is a torrent of activity completely unrelated to my task at hand, so I am writing this to get these thoughts out so I can get back to work.<p />I got a call from a recruiter the other day trying to get me to come interview at this job. Right now I am working in VB.NET and Actionscript. Until this job, I was always working in open-source languages: Perl, PHP, and some Java. This is my first real divergence from that pattern, and of course it is in two languages that are, to say the least, not very popular with the open source crowd. This gets me wondering, "what if when I decide to move on, all the fun jobs look down their noses at me for working in unpopular languages?".<p /> To be fair, I still program quite a bit outside work in my favorite languages, and that is all well and good.<p />For some reason though, that recruiter really got under my skin. I keep asking myself questions like, "is spending time right now making a Java game for the Android a good choice long term?" or, "should I spend any more time learning Python with Django, or just get more invested in Javascript and node.js?".<p /> These are not questions I want to be asking myself. <p />So, I sit down to think about it and get it out of my system. What kind of programmer do I want to be in 5 years? I know without a moment's hesitation. <p /> <strong>I want to be the kind of programmer who is not tied to any one language or platform, but is instantly effective and rapidly excellent in </strong><strong><em>every</em> language and platform. </strong><p />Right now, I am learning Common Lisp. Why? To learn better functional programming. Why do I play with Javascript? To be better at client-side web programming. PHP/Python? Server-side web programming. *.NET? Compiled, versioned programming. Android games? For fun! Why do I all this? Because the programmer I want to be is not constrained to his language/platform<em> at all</em>. The programmer I want to be programs at a level <em>over the language</em>.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  In ancient times, plenty of builders did their work without math,
  and I would guess that a good portion of them likely did it faster
  then their math-doing counterparts.
</p>
<p >
  I am certain that when builders first started using math to prove
  that buildings would stand up safely, they were mocked by their
  math-less counterparts. I can hear them now, "Oh, Stephos, it takes
  you 5 times longer to prove your building will stand up, real men
  can just <em>see</em> that it will work". Even in modern times, many
  people build houses and small buildings that probably don't even
  need the math to really "prove" they work, but they perform the due
  diligence anyway. On the other hand, some people today still build
  houses, sheds, tree-houses, lofts, and fire pits without any
  drawings or math at at all, and why should they? They are
  responsible for the risk.
</p>
<p >
  This is all fine, but, builders who shy away from math also don't
  build airliners, space shuttles, and skyscrapers. An aircraft
  designer who doesn't feel like using math to prove their aircraft
  will fly is handed an "Experimental" sticker and gravely patted on
  the back.
</p>
<p >
  Today, programming is at the same place as both
  ancient <strong>and</strong> modern engineering: many projects can
  be done "by eye", and some of the most experienced programmers are
  able to build immense projects alone without any sort of automated
  testing at all. When you go to a forum and ask for help, you are
  just as likely to hear from a "space shuttle" programmer as you are
  to hear from a "tin shack" programmer. The "space shuttle"
  programmer would be horrified to hear of working without automated
  testing and rigorous review practices, whereas the "tin shack"
  programmer would be horrified to think of the time wasted to
  even <em>learn the procedures</em> to automatically prove his code
  works as it should. The "space shuttle" programmer might work on the
  same internal financial project for months or years, finally
  releasing with zero defects; the "tin shack" programmer might churn
  out several quick web sites a day. Neither project
  is <em>better</em> then the other, they both might be perfect for
  what their business needs.
</p>
<p>
  I have heard several times from very good lone wolf programmers that
  testing just slows them down, and in some ways, it does appear to be
  a slowdown for them. Unfortunately, the cost to build even
  medium-sized projects with several workers without automated testing
  is only felt when it is too late, when the deadlines (and costs) are
  spiraling out of control.
</p>
<p>
  The disciplined application of mathematics transformed and
  solidified the field of engineering into a field far more vast and
  capable of some of the most incredible constructions imaginable.
  Would we have smart-phones, GPS, modern cars, and airliners if
  engineering had just avoided mathematics? Just imagine what the
  field of programming could grow into if we continue to learn and
  grow our testing, designing, and writing of software.
</p>
<p>
  I propose that automated testing is to programming what math was
  to ancient engineering.
