  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing I strongly recommend to developers when starting at a new job is to keep a list of everything that bothers you.</p>

<p>For every new company you work at, there will always be a set of things that you see as pain points, because you came from a place that did those things differently.</p>

<p>Notice I said differently, not better.</p>

<p>All of us have certain irrational attachments to the various things we are used to doing: things we do not because it’s the best way to do them, but because it’s become comfortable to do them that way. I have seen new developers come onto a team and complain endlessly about something that is clearly a net benefit for them and the team. However, the team is so used to doing it their way that they cannot imagine changing.</p>

<p>Allow me to share a personally painful example.</p>

<p>Much to my regret, when I moved into .NET development coming from the scripting world, I complained non-stop about how annoying it was to have to assign a type to everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><p>“I mean, in perl and php we got along great without it, so why on earth should anyone have to go through all this extra hassle?”</p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t realize how strong typing enabled very powerful tooling, and to be perfectly honest, I probably didn’t care. However, I did realize that my complaints were falling on deaf ears. My co-workers, who had never even looked at a dynamically typed language before, didn’t care. Much worse, I was alienating myself from them, becoming<em> that guy</em>, the one who just complains all the time. I sucked.</p>

<p>So, I decided on a new policy. Whenever something offended my sensibilities, seeming worse, wrong or just different, I would document it in a to-do list (I use <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> in emacs, because it’s mind-alteringly cool). I would stop complaining about it, stop making sidelong hints at it. I would just add it to the list. Apparently, I was pretty opinionated about how to make that team better, because that list grew monstrously large in just a few months.</p>

<p>Next, I would review that list every week. Whenever I had downtime I would pick something small and try to implement whatever I needed to make that work, things like:  like installing a CI server, or figuring out how to unit test this crazy actionscript fla.</p>

<p>If an issue was too large or I lacked the understanding to resolve all at once, I would do root cause analysis and brainstorm different ways to achieve the goal. Sometimes, I would take something off the list, either because it was too costly to justify its value, or because sometimes I realized I was grossly incorrect in my understanding of the issue.</p>

<p>So, back to my example about static typing. After about a year, I realized there was no way I could reasonably argue it was worth a change. No one but me cared, no one was interested in<a href="http://deliberate-software.com/how-to-escape-from-programming_language/" target="_blank"> learning new languages to try to use for development</a>, and the cost to convert anyway would have been staggering (and conversion was likely impossible).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I learned that while static typing is a cost of doing business in some languages, statically-typed languages lead the modern pack for powerful refactoring tooling (at least ‘til Yegge’s team finishes their quest for the Holy Grail (the <a href="https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4vQtz">Grok Project</a>; search that post for grok. And I said modern tools, so no smalltalk flame!)). My arguments advocating a change basically fell into two categories:: “I like it better”, and, “you won’t miss those refactoring and intellisense tools much”. You can imagine my co-workers’ reaction to either category: *Sad trombone*. Good thing I was keeping them all to myself in my to-do list.</p>

<p>This process, this simple change, powerfully changed my behavior and attitude. I am convinced that it helped me to mature, both socially and as a developer. No longer was I the whiny developer looking to his team lead to “kiss his boo-boos”, I was learning to weigh cost/benefits of both my short- and long-term goals for that team.</p>

<p>I also discovered a serendipitous side-effect from my todo-list. After about a year and a half when all the pain points had grown calloused, I was able to look back over my list for outstanding reminders of points of our process, still needing refinement. It was a way for me to reconnect with my <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?BeginnersMind">beginners mind</a>, and it was very helpful.</p>

<p>Since I started this process have I been able to participate in many discussions about an idea, article, or pain point another developer had mentioned where I have already thought through my position, because it is either something I have already noticed and have been working on a solution for, or I have been researching it, or I concluded (from my limited perspective) it wasn’t worth the effort.</p>

<p>Not many people reflect this deeply or have their thoughts so organized on important subjects affecting their work. It would make a powerful impression were you to find yourself involved in a hallway discussion with your boss about training, and you could nonchalantly add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><p>“Oh, new hire training. Yes, I have been considering how we train new hires for a long time, and I have a few ideas here on what would help our particular needs.”</p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, a few times something I had previously concluded wasn’t worth the effort due to internal political reasons suddenly has become possible, and I have been able to lead the group in that new endeavor, having spent effort considering and concluding how to best implement it.</p>

<p>When you find yourself complaining about the pain of a new job, don’t be a whiner. Don’t try to bully the other developers into doing things according to your “obviously better” way. Write your pain points down and start planning how you can truly impact your team for the best.</p>

<time class='entry-date' datetime='2012-10-01T00:00:00-04:00'><span class='date'><span class='date-month'>Oct</span> <span class='date-day'>1</span><span class='date-suffix'>st</span>, <span class='date-year'>2012</span></span> <span class='time'>12:00 am</span></time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ego Driven Development, (EDD), is a software development anti-pattern where
developers and managers repeatedly act as if established best practices do not
apply to them, to the detriment of their organization. Institutional ego is most
often to blame.</p>

<p>EDD plagues many organizations; here just some of the symptoms you might
encounter:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>&ldquo;Not Invented Here&rdquo; syndrome.</strong> Expressed most commonly in a desire for
everything needed to be developed in house. E.g.: &ldquo;Need a CMS? Let&rsquo;s make our
own from scratch!&rdquo; Perhaps, you work at a place where all your teammates do is
constantly bring you bad ideas. Are they really all terrible? Or are only your
ideas good enough for the organization? Not Invented Here can also apply to
your own head, not just the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Little to no test coverage of domain logic.</strong> There are plenty of great
developers who do not need automated tests to remember all the little quirks of
their systems when working alone, and that works fine until you bring on a
second developer. Domain logic tests are about increasing communication and
speed for the team, and they are part of being a good citizen of a team.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No dedicated UI person for external user interfaces or no actual user
testing.</strong> Either the developers or the manager think they are good enough to
design excellent and understandable user interfaces or do not realize the
importance of this. Think of a &ldquo;Steve Jobs&rdquo;-type manager who imagines himself to
be a prodigy of design and usability, or the developer who &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t think design
is all that hard&rdquo;. Real users trying out your software for a few minutes will
tell you more than you would believe.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No dedicated QA for externally-facing software.</strong> Someone who is experienced
at breaking software should have a crack at it before it goes to users.
Developers (including me) are too enamored with their own work to really take
the time to break it, so someone with a sense of pride in finding problems needs
to be given the task.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>&ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Tower">Ivory Tower</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">Architecture Astronaut</a>&rdquo; team leads.</strong> The team member that is focused on &ldquo;perfection&rdquo; of
the design or code to the detriment of the business. This is not an easy
distinction to make, and no one becomes this without a heart full of good
intentions. &ldquo;If only the test coverage could be higher&rdquo; (when it is already
high) or &ldquo;we can make our own programming language to solve this so much more
elegantly&rdquo;. Like I said, a fine line that takes many years of experience and
deep familiarity with the business and the domain to discern.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Broad skill level spectrum (that stays static).</strong> A huge gap in skill level
between the best and worst team members. Most often happens when a bunch of new
hires come on board, and were not skilled enough for the task or were not
trained properly. The original team members decide the new members are &ldquo;not
worth the effort&rdquo; and neglect to train them in the hopes they will be fired.
Months, or even years later, the &ldquo;new members&rdquo; are still struggling along,
berated by the &ldquo;elites&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No pair programming.</strong> Very few activities will raise the water level for
all the team members like pairing. It trains new developers quickly, as well as
allows the older developers to see the pain points of a system through a new set
of eyes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Micro-management in some areas, no management in others.</strong> When leads and
managers put too much effort and management into some areas, to the neglect of
other areas. Some tickets will be crammed with detail down to the database
column names, others will be one-liners covering a month of work. Typically,
this is a top-down effect, starting at upper management and trickling down to
the lowest levels. Whatever the &ldquo;eye of Sauron&rdquo; is focused on is what the whole
chain of command suddenly turns its laser focus towards, while the rest of the
projects/tickets are abandoned by all but the developer assigned to the ticket.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Agile &ldquo;Lite&rdquo;.</strong> Everyone pretty much has heard that agile is a fast
development methodology. What often happens is that management either does not
learn enough about it to implement correctly, or does not like the &ldquo;chaotic&rdquo;
nature of true agile, and so attempts to adopt the &ldquo;best parts&rdquo;. Typically this
means splitting work into &ldquo;sprints&rdquo; and having a &ldquo;stand-up&rdquo;, while developers
all just work off of tickets assigned and estimated by their leads. Often this
happens because the person who makes the call on whether or not to implement
agile falsely believes themselves (and the team) to be &ldquo;good enough to not need
it&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Joel Test</a> score.</strong> The Joel Test remains a great indicator of institutional ego.
A team that scores low on the Joel Test does so because someone along the way
decided that, &ldquo;nah, we don&rsquo;t need that here, we are special&rdquo;, and almost
certainly they are not. I have yet to hear of a team with a legitimate reason
for a low Joel Test score.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low pay.</strong> Ah, yes, the shops that pay their developers significantly
lower than the average in that location, language, and experience. This one is
hard, because it really is almost always up to just one person, and the
developer usually only gets to vote with their feet: by either staying or going.
If you are that person, you had best consider what you are missing out on by
remaining in a positon where you are underpaid.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Ego driven development is unfortunately self-reinforcing. Much of it is caused
by individual pride, and usually it is driven by someone towards the top of the
chain of command. While it can be a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle#Vicious_circle_2">vicious cycle</a> trickling down, it is possible to break out of the loop by fighting
back against EDD with humility and an attitude of just doing what&rsquo;s best for the
team. I have seen managers take tremendous crap from above, and never let a bit
of it touch those below them. Those managers were heroes we all fought to
impress, because we knew how hard they worked to make our teams better. I have
seen experienced developers swallow their pride, and do the boring, tedious,
hard, and less fun work for the betterment of the whole, in the process grew
into someone much more productive.</p>

<p>EDD is possible to defeat. Treat everyone with respect, and praise what steps
they do take in the right direction. Set aside your ego, and when you get
micro-managed and treated with disdain from those above you, do what it takes to
make sure that doesn&rsquo;t trickle down to those below you and at your level. Pick a
few things on this list that you know you are not doing well, and tackle the
root cause. Swallow your pride, and do your part to be excellent, and your work
will thrive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a method I use for rapidly learning new programming languages that I wanted to share because I have not really seen it documented anywhere else. This technique is not for the faint of heart, but it is a lot of fun. Many of you old hands and graybeards probably already do this, but for those that don't, you have got to give it a shot at least once. You'll never be the same. And no, I am not talking about <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, although that has its place.</p><p>First, do a bit of research, and get your hands on the best book on the language you can find. Second, research the language, and pick a project to which it is well suited. For example, to learn Clojure, I decided to re-write an old php project from scratch that I was well familiar with. (This also gives me the neat data point of seeing how much smaller the project is in Clojure)&nbsp;Try not to be too ambitious here, you want something you could pull off in your current go-to language.</p><p>Start the project, and work under a dozen hours on it, bashing your way through the first pains of installing the language/framework (my least favorite part), and getting a basic proof of concept together. If it's a web site, think "hello world" coming out of your database of choice. Tell all your friends what you are going to make, and when it is launching. Make sure the launch date is ambitious. Start to read the book splitting your time roughly 25/75 between reading and programming, using what you read to provide you with "ammunition" for your project. Do this in as short a loop as possible, so the reading and programming are never far apart.</p><p>Since you will be fighting through real problems, the reading is a hundred times more interesting. Almost every page you will have to stop yourself from shouting, "OF COURSE!" out loud at the book, because you have just discovered something that is an extremely real pain point to you. <span>You may find yourself laughing more than once in sheer delight</span> because you anticipated a part of the language correctly, and just found the syntax for it. If that is not happening, you probably need to adjust the ratio of programming to reading. You want to find that sweet spot of just barely learning what you need to succeed, and constantly being "saved" by reading that last tidbit last night. If even the simplest things take unpleasantly long, perhaps more reading. If the reading is dragging too much, try more programming. When you hit that sweet spot, the programming is an exhilarating rush, and the reading is actually fun. If none of these happen, perhaps you are learning a language that does not really teach you anything new, just a different syntax for the same thing you are used to doing, in which case, ask yourself why you are learning that language. There are plenty out there that will <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">blow your mind</a>.</p><p>Don't forget that deadline either, your friends and family are waiting, remember? Hustle is the name of the game here, and don't worry, you'll make tons of mistakes, and you'll never forget a single one. Who cares? (No one will ever know but you!) If experience is learning from a lot of mistakes, you'll be the most experienced person around!</p><p>When that deadline looms, don't give up! Step up your game, slash the second-best features, and race for the finish. If you are way off your mark, you can consider pushing the date back, but still deliver something on your original date. Once you are done, unwind for a few months, take it easy, then repeat. After a couple of those iterations you will be seriously more experienced in a wide variety of languages, and you will find yourself much more confident in your language-that-pays.</p><p>Do this a couple of times and you'll not only get better at that language, you'll get better at all of them. You will start to see the underlying concepts that cause languages to be written the way they are. The language families will start to run together, and you will develop the intuition of what you need to do with just the trivial task of remembering (or looking up) the syntax. Your programming skill will move to a higher plane of abstraction, and you will think outside the specific language. The language just becomes an implementation detail, just words that tell the compiler or interpreter what you mean. Reading other people's code will become significantly easier, and you will find learning a new language is almost faster reading the masters' code on github than with a book at all.</p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> <span>Don't let what little time you have discourage  you. A few minutes a day sneaking in one more function is better than a  few minutes a day moping in front of the TV wishing you had more time  for programming. </span>I understand not everyone can put in "this kind of time" (or energy) into side projects. Heck, plenty of times I cannot either. Sometimes, you only have a few hours a month on the good months. That's fine. Take that date, stretch it out to the end of the year. Slip in that reading on the ride home, or at lunch. Make every moment you spend on it count.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have often thought whenever I meet a programmer who is obviously grossly incompetent that there needs to be some sort of certification board for software engineering that can help enforce some minimal skills to help weed out the riff-raff.<p /> Obviously, this is completely impossible. The tools and community change so fast that individuals are barely able to stay on top; good luck getting a standards committee to completely revise every few months. Who would be on the committee? And what would they agree on to enforce? Regex? Recursion, OO, testability, and functional programming?&nbsp; Proof of understanding in the half-dozen <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html" target="_blank">"mind expanding"</a> languages? Not going to happen. Not while my Joomla-site maintaining friend and my Android 3D game authoring cohort are both lumped under the title "software developer". The field is too vast, the content too broad, and the jobs too diverse. <p /> So, we are doomed to wallow. Or are we? What is the one thing we all have to do?<em> Get hired.</em><p />I used to be a big sissy about interviewing for jobs. Especially interviews full of the nit-picky details I can never remember, yeah, I <em>really</em> hate those. I would moan and groan about how the interviewer could only answer those questions because they had to look them up the other day. "MySQL index implementations, what am I, a DBA?!", I would screech to anyone who would listen, "They must have misunderstood, I am a developer, when would I ever need to know that?!"<p /> But.<p />Interview prep gets me to cram stuff into my head I would otherwise skim or avoid if just sitting at home programming for fun. I get a great refresher on all the stuff I am fully able to do at work, but maybe I haven't needed in a while. Like linked-lists. In four years of fairly diverse programming jobs, I have<strong> yet</strong> to need a linked list for anything, but man, when that day comes, I have linked-lists in a quick-draw holster. I used to say the same thing about trees, then last year, I had a problem that surely needed a tree, and hear you me, I had that data being in-order traversed before you could say: "tree". Would I have even <em>remembered</em> <em>what trees are good for</em> without my semi-annual refresher?<p /> My wife is a commercial pilot, and every so often she is required to skim over all those little details about being a pilot, refreshing <em>everything</em>, double-checking her knowledge so she can keep her licenses, <em>even if she hasn't needed a certain technique since the last test</em>. Huh. Sounds like me, every so often, cramming for an interview.<p />  We don't need certifications for being a programmer. We already have the tools in hand, and just need to learn to use them better. <strong>Interviews are our certifications. </strong></p><p>This is a double-edged sword, because this means that, "what you sow, you will also reap".  The responsibility to keep standards high falls on the interviewer. If  you interview a candidate for tricky puzzle questions, or in-depth  knowledge of C++ libraries, you will find someone who knows those  things, and possibly ONLY knows those things. I have seen developers hired who couldn't handle VCS merging or shipping actual software, but were absolute <em>geniuses</em> when it came to programming language trivia and puzzle questions.</p><p>A few months ago, I read of a guy with no programming experience who did like 100 interviews in a few weeks, till he was a master interviewee. By the end, he was able to pick his choice of companies, and <strong>yet </strong><strong>he couldn't ship software</strong>. He gamed a system <em>intended</em> to sort out good developers by asking questions that are ancillary to development, without actually having the candidate <em>prove any real ability</em>. And now that company has a developer who is great at gaming systems, but unskilled at development: I hope they have a good training program.</p><p>No offense intended to the man who did this, I <strong>really </strong>admire his tenacity and clever thinking, and I think he will do well regardless of the task. But it speaks volumes to the brokenness of the interview system for those companies that would hire a completely unskilled developer based on the correct answers to trivia questions about programming.</p><p>Parting question to consider for interviewers: if interviews are our certifications, what should a candidate be able to do to be "certified" to be able to do the job in question?</p>
