  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a method I use for rapidly learning new programming languages that I wanted to share because I have not really seen it documented anywhere else. This technique is not for the faint of heart, but it is a lot of fun. Many of you old hands and graybeards probably already do this, but for those that don't, you have got to give it a shot at least once. You'll never be the same. And no, I am not talking about <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, although that has its place.</p><p>First, do a bit of research, and get your hands on the best book on the language you can find. Second, research the language, and pick a project to which it is well suited. For example, to learn Clojure, I decided to re-write an old php project from scratch that I was well familiar with. (This also gives me the neat data point of seeing how much smaller the project is in Clojure)&nbsp;Try not to be too ambitious here, you want something you could pull off in your current go-to language.</p><p>Start the project, and work under a dozen hours on it, bashing your way through the first pains of installing the language/framework (my least favorite part), and getting a basic proof of concept together. If it's a web site, think "hello world" coming out of your database of choice. Tell all your friends what you are going to make, and when it is launching. Make sure the launch date is ambitious. Start to read the book splitting your time roughly 25/75 between reading and programming, using what you read to provide you with "ammunition" for your project. Do this in as short a loop as possible, so the reading and programming are never far apart.</p><p>Since you will be fighting through real problems, the reading is a hundred times more interesting. Almost every page you will have to stop yourself from shouting, "OF COURSE!" out loud at the book, because you have just discovered something that is an extremely real pain point to you. <span>You may find yourself laughing more than once in sheer delight</span> because you anticipated a part of the language correctly, and just found the syntax for it. If that is not happening, you probably need to adjust the ratio of programming to reading. You want to find that sweet spot of just barely learning what you need to succeed, and constantly being "saved" by reading that last tidbit last night. If even the simplest things take unpleasantly long, perhaps more reading. If the reading is dragging too much, try more programming. When you hit that sweet spot, the programming is an exhilarating rush, and the reading is actually fun. If none of these happen, perhaps you are learning a language that does not really teach you anything new, just a different syntax for the same thing you are used to doing, in which case, ask yourself why you are learning that language. There are plenty out there that will <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">blow your mind</a>.</p><p>Don't forget that deadline either, your friends and family are waiting, remember? Hustle is the name of the game here, and don't worry, you'll make tons of mistakes, and you'll never forget a single one. Who cares? (No one will ever know but you!) If experience is learning from a lot of mistakes, you'll be the most experienced person around!</p><p>When that deadline looms, don't give up! Step up your game, slash the second-best features, and race for the finish. If you are way off your mark, you can consider pushing the date back, but still deliver something on your original date. Once you are done, unwind for a few months, take it easy, then repeat. After a couple of those iterations you will be seriously more experienced in a wide variety of languages, and you will find yourself much more confident in your language-that-pays.</p><p>Do this a couple of times and you'll not only get better at that language, you'll get better at all of them. You will start to see the underlying concepts that cause languages to be written the way they are. The language families will start to run together, and you will develop the intuition of what you need to do with just the trivial task of remembering (or looking up) the syntax. Your programming skill will move to a higher plane of abstraction, and you will think outside the specific language. The language just becomes an implementation detail, just words that tell the compiler or interpreter what you mean. Reading other people's code will become significantly easier, and you will find learning a new language is almost faster reading the masters' code on github than with a book at all.</p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> <span>Don't let what little time you have discourage  you. A few minutes a day sneaking in one more function is better than a  few minutes a day moping in front of the TV wishing you had more time  for programming. </span>I understand not everyone can put in "this kind of time" (or energy) into side projects. Heck, plenty of times I cannot either. Sometimes, you only have a few hours a month on the good months. That's fine. Take that date, stretch it out to the end of the year. Slip in that reading on the ride home, or at lunch. Make every moment you spend on it count.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have often thought whenever I meet a programmer who is obviously grossly incompetent that there needs to be some sort of certification board for software engineering that can help enforce some minimal skills to help weed out the riff-raff.<p /> Obviously, this is completely impossible. The tools and community change so fast that individuals are barely able to stay on top; good luck getting a standards committee to completely revise every few months. Who would be on the committee? And what would they agree on to enforce? Regex? Recursion, OO, testability, and functional programming?&nbsp; Proof of understanding in the half-dozen <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html" target="_blank">"mind expanding"</a> languages? Not going to happen. Not while my Joomla-site maintaining friend and my Android 3D game authoring cohort are both lumped under the title "software developer". The field is too vast, the content too broad, and the jobs too diverse. <p /> So, we are doomed to wallow. Or are we? What is the one thing we all have to do?<em> Get hired.</em><p />I used to be a big sissy about interviewing for jobs. Especially interviews full of the nit-picky details I can never remember, yeah, I <em>really</em> hate those. I would moan and groan about how the interviewer could only answer those questions because they had to look them up the other day. "MySQL index implementations, what am I, a DBA?!", I would screech to anyone who would listen, "They must have misunderstood, I am a developer, when would I ever need to know that?!"<p /> But.<p />Interview prep gets me to cram stuff into my head I would otherwise skim or avoid if just sitting at home programming for fun. I get a great refresher on all the stuff I am fully able to do at work, but maybe I haven't needed in a while. Like linked-lists. In four years of fairly diverse programming jobs, I have<strong> yet</strong> to need a linked list for anything, but man, when that day comes, I have linked-lists in a quick-draw holster. I used to say the same thing about trees, then last year, I had a problem that surely needed a tree, and hear you me, I had that data being in-order traversed before you could say: "tree". Would I have even <em>remembered</em> <em>what trees are good for</em> without my semi-annual refresher?<p /> My wife is a commercial pilot, and every so often she is required to skim over all those little details about being a pilot, refreshing <em>everything</em>, double-checking her knowledge so she can keep her licenses, <em>even if she hasn't needed a certain technique since the last test</em>. Huh. Sounds like me, every so often, cramming for an interview.<p />  We don't need certifications for being a programmer. We already have the tools in hand, and just need to learn to use them better. <strong>Interviews are our certifications. </strong></p><p>This is a double-edged sword, because this means that, "what you sow, you will also reap".  The responsibility to keep standards high falls on the interviewer. If  you interview a candidate for tricky puzzle questions, or in-depth  knowledge of C++ libraries, you will find someone who knows those  things, and possibly ONLY knows those things. I have seen developers hired who couldn't handle VCS merging or shipping actual software, but were absolute <em>geniuses</em> when it came to programming language trivia and puzzle questions.</p><p>A few months ago, I read of a guy with no programming experience who did like 100 interviews in a few weeks, till he was a master interviewee. By the end, he was able to pick his choice of companies, and <strong>yet </strong><strong>he couldn't ship software</strong>. He gamed a system <em>intended</em> to sort out good developers by asking questions that are ancillary to development, without actually having the candidate <em>prove any real ability</em>. And now that company has a developer who is great at gaming systems, but unskilled at development: I hope they have a good training program.</p><p>No offense intended to the man who did this, I <strong>really </strong>admire his tenacity and clever thinking, and I think he will do well regardless of the task. But it speaks volumes to the brokenness of the interview system for those companies that would hire a completely unskilled developer based on the correct answers to trivia questions about programming.</p><p>Parting question to consider for interviewers: if interviews are our certifications, what should a candidate be able to do to be "certified" to be able to do the job in question?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately, I have been deliberating on <strong>quality</strong> <strong>vs. speed</strong>. Throughout my career, I have worked with developers who basically consider quality to be a programmer's vice, an extravagance only for the navel-gazing idealists. I have also worked with developers who consider <em>all </em>time spent on quality to be of the utmost importance, and that programming for speed is for those lazy and slapdash realists. I recently read Yegge's post <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html">Done, and Get's Things Smart</a>, and I think I agree with Yegge on this point, that it <em>is</em> possible to perform fast and with high quality, and like a wandering samurai, that is the path I seek. <p />  There are many facets to this, of course, but I have been playing with this mental model. Specifically, my insight here is a new definition of quality: <strong>quality is future speed</strong>. In my mind, quality that is not for future speed <strong>is</strong> an extravagance, something programmers do to entertain themselves, and it is worse than cutting corners in the present, because it sacrifices current work for no future gain. <p />  Lately, my personal projects have taken a certain theme: I want more practice tuning my programming to be as fast as possible <em>both for today and for the future</em>. And to be perfectly honest, usually there is a lot more "future" in most systems than just "today". <p />  So, how have I been doing this? I set arbitrarily short deadlines for myself, so I am forced to practice dropping anything that is not directly related to speed. I then try to rotate projects every month, so I am forced to return to old work, to learn better where I made bad choices that cost me <em>future </em>speed. <p />  Doing this with the right mindset is very humbling, and very insightful. Honestly, this may happen at work accidentally from time to time as well, but rarely at work am I able to carefully reflect on the mistakes of the past. At home, the pain I feel is my own, no one suffers at home other than me, and there is no one to blame but myself. If an architecture is brittle, or the test coverage is low, or the design is resistant to change, (all of which have happened) I am able to take those lessons to heart <em>because I directly caused those problems</em>.<p />  I encourage anyone who, like me, seeks to be a more excellent developer, to give this a try: start a couple of side projects (and don't worry, it took me a year to get the ones I have), and set yourself some crazy tight "delivery dates". Heck, make real products and try to make some money off them, maybe you will be able to get some side-cash! But then, after you have "delivered", take some time to rest, maybe read a book or two, tinker with some other projects, and after a break, return to analyze your past work. Set yourself another strict deadline, try to make a second version, or add some more features. You will find some incredibly valuable lessons there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>December 1st, I made myself a New Year's resolution to completely create an Android game that I would not be ashamed to show people from (mostly) scratch before the end of December. What made it the most fun was that I started with practically no experience with the Android platform at all, and so I got to pick it up by the seat of my pants.<p />The biggest challenge was probably the last three days, where I was faced with some hard calls, when the deadline loomed, and my still mile-long list of wants had to be pruned down just about every few hours. I basically had a "buggy beta" by Wednesday morning, and all the problems remaining were ones I didn't know how to solve or hide, and while all the graphics where there, I could barely stand to look at them. I felt like I was spinning my wheels with no progress. My friend Dan tried to talk me down, pointing out with some clarity that there was no gun to my head, and I was doing this for myself, so I could stop any time. Amusingly enough, that was exactly what I needed to hear. I was doing this for myself, to better myself, to learn more discipline. I wanted to stretch my abilities to the limits. So, I pushed through. I found a book that showed me how to fix my problems, and I didn't stop until every bug I could find was fixed, and everything my poor family pointed out (I made them each play it like a dozen different times) was smoothed.<p />  And last night, after about a hundred hours of total work this month, I slid under the wire with roughly two hours to spare. The game is not in the market YET, because at the end of it all, I concluded I would rather spend the few dozen more hours to convert it to OpenGL ES, and add in a few neat things I was unable to do using the Android canvas, but for a v1, I am immensely proud of the whole experience.<p />I can say, unequivocally; WHEW. <p />This challenge was a fantastic learning experience, and I had several great reminders of what my dad always told me growing up: <strong>just work smarter, son, not harder</strong>.</p>
